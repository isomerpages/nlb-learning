<h3><b>Learning Package</b></h3>
Get a glimpse of what it takes to achieve your aspirations with these articles and activities.

<h5 class="margin--bottom--lg" id="lp-wants"><b>Needs! Or... Wants?</b></h5>

**Needs** are things we **must have** to survive (e.g. food, water, clothes, shelter)

**Wants** are things we would like to have, but are **not required** for survival (e.g. luxury goods, games, toys)

Learn about needs and wants in the little game titled:

**The 10 Bean Allowance**

Adapted from "The Bean Game" by Jana Darrington, this game helps you better understand your spending choices and priorities. Everyone starts off with 10 beans and decides on which areas they would like to allocate the beans to. The four areas are: 
Food,
Clothing, 
Leisure, and 
Transport! 
Let's *bean-gin*!

![beans counter](/images/career/teens/beans.jpg)

*Guiding Questions*

*1\.How did you spend your beans?  
2\. Did you spend mostly on needs or wants?  
3\. If your allowance next month is reduced to 5 beans...
how would that change your spending choices?*

**Making Financial Decisions**

Let's learn about Principal and Interest!

**Principal** is the initial amount of money borrowed before interest is accrued.

**Interest** is the price you pay to borrow money or the cost you charge to lend money. Simple Interest is the interest calculated on the original principal loan only. Compound Interest is the interest that accrues on both the original principal loan and the accumulated interest from previous periods.

Let's further our understanding of Principal and Interest with the next activity!

**Let's Help John!**

John wants to buy a new phone, but it costs $1,000! He only has $300 now and he can only save $100 a month, what are his options?

![John 1](/images/career/teens/John%20q.jpg)
![John 2](/images/career/teens/John%202.jpg)
*How should we advise John?
<br>1. Does John need the item immediately?  <br>2. Does John mind paying a little extra to split the payment into instalments? 
<br>3. Will John have enough to pay off the credit card bill on time, and in full? <br>4. Is there a trade-off for using the money now?*

<h5 class="margin--bottom--lg" id="lp-started1"><b>Time to Get Started! Part 1</b></h5>

It’s a brand new year – and the perfect time to begin planning out activities that can help forge your future path. Whether it’s during term time or during the holidays, here’s how you can get started on your future aspirations. 

**Part 1: Discover Yourself and Explore What’s Out There!**

![Aristotle Quote](/images/career/teens/Aristotle.png)

Unsure of where to start? Getting to know yourself a little bit better is a great first step, like knowing what you excel in, or knowing what sort of lifestyle you would like to live.

![](/images/career/teens/jobs.png)

Take the time to do quizzes like these: [Know Yourself ](https://www.myskillsfuture.gov.sg/content/student/en/secondary/assessment.html). Just log in (based on which school you are in) and get started to find out about your interests, skills, values and learning styles. 

![](/images/career/teens/jobs%202.png)

Take a look at what is available from platforms such as these: [Singapore Industry Landscape](https://www.myskillsfuture.gov.sg/content/student/en/preu/world-of-work/industry-landscape.html) for a better idea of what future roles and responsibilities might suit you. Knowing where you could be headed is a great starting point to planning the steps you will need to take to get there.

![](/images/career/teens/jobs%203.png)

Remember that all these tools are here to guide you along and not to instruct you, so answer honestly and don’t feel pressured. Some jobs in the future might not even currently be available yet as the world is always changing!

![Spielberg quote](/images/career/teens/Spielberg%20quote.png)

Aside from being a great way to de-stress and have fun, extra-curricular activities and hobbies are often where our passions lie. From sports to arts and music, the pursuit of these interests could even form the backbone of your future career. 

![](/images/career/teens/jobs%206.png)

Use the time you currently have to start creating or working on projects – this can help build up your portfolio and develop your own style which you can use to track your growth and showcase your repertoire of talents. Discover which online or offline platforms suit you best and start learning about them. For example, if you have a passion for animation, you may work on a short animated clip of your choice which you can post on your blog or Instagram reel as a way to showcase and get feedback on your work.

![](/images/career/teens/jobs%207.png)

Use the opportunities you have to get experiences and get in hours of practice. Find like-minded communities and immerse yourself in a wide variety of projects and activities that will expand your range and exposure. For example, if you enjoy designing and knowing how things work, you can join NLB’s MakeIT community on Facebook where you can find like-minded tinkerers as well as programmes you can attend. 

![](/images/career/teens/jobs%209.png)

Some of these passion projects can be turned into temporary or permanent businesses along your career path. You will need to be very self-motivated and consistently work on your skills, but there is no time like the present to try out these ideas if you have the capacity, resources and have done the due research.

![Obama Quote](/images/career/teens/Mich%20Obs.png)

Real life experiences are important and valuable – it will help you stand out from the crowd. Apply for a temporary or part-time position related to your interests. This short stint can help you identify whether you are suited for this industry and show future employees that you are ready!

![Network](/images/career/teens/jobs%2010.png)

**Be proactive**. Do you know anyone in the industry you are interested in? Ask them more about it and if they have any advice or positions available. Write in to organisations to apply as an intern or volunteer – don’t give up your search even if you get some rejection letters, as there will be some companies who will give you the chance to learn on the job or shadow their professionals even if you do not have the relevant experience. While you might not get as much pay, this is still a great way to experience a job first hand and build up your resume. 

![skills](/images/career/teens/jobs%2011.png)

**Be resourceful**. Even if you take on an unrelated volunteer role to give back to society, or a part-time job to earn a little extra income, make sure to keep a record of what you have done. There are many applicable skills you could list on your resume from these experiences such as leadership and teamwork skills, event planning and facilitation skills etc. For example, if you worked part-time as a waiter, you could list skills such as being able to work in a team, show good customer service as well as adapt to a fast-paced environment. 

It’s never too early to figure out what you might want to do in the future and how you can get there. Remember that at the end of the day, there’s really no rush. Take a deep breath and take your time to explore. Every career path is crafted according to the opportunities you take and the effort you put in, while taking the rest you need to recharge. So be brave and step out!

In the real world, Eliza Mirk is shy, weird, and friendless. Online, Eliza is LadyConstellation, anonymous creator of a popular webcomic called Monstrous Sea. With millions of followers and fans throughout the world, Eliza’s persona is popular. Eliza can’t imagine enjoying the real world as much as she loves her digital community.

Then Wallace Warland transfers to her school and Eliza begins to wonder if a life offline might be worthwhile. But when Eliza’s secret is accidentally shared with the world, everything she’s built—her story, her relationship with Wallace, and even her sanity—begins to fall apart.
