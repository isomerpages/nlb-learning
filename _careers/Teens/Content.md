Call No.: Y ZAP<br>
Publisher: Greenwillow Books, 2017<br>
Also available as an eBook on [NLB OverDrive](https://nlb.overdrive.com/library/teens/media/2948046){:target="_blank" .has-text-ruby}.

In the real world, Eliza Mirk is shy, weird, and friendless. Online, Eliza is LadyConstellation, anonymous creator of a popular webcomic called Monstrous Sea. With millions of followers and fans throughout the world, Eliza’s persona is popular. Eliza can’t imagine enjoying the real world as much as she loves her digital community.

Then Wallace Warland transfers to her school and Eliza begins to wonder if a life offline might be worthwhile. But when Eliza’s secret is accidentally shared with the world, everything she’s built—her story, her relationship with Wallace, and even her sanity—begins to fall apart.
