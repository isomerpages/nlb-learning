<h5 class="margin--bottom--lg" id="lp-email"><b>Time to Get Started!</b></h5>

It’s a brand new year – and the perfect time to begin planning out activities that can help forge your future path. Whether it’s during term time or during the holidays, here’s how you can get started on your future aspirations. 

Part 1: Discover Yourself and Explore What’s Out There!
Unsure of where to start? Getting to know yourself a little bit better is a great first step, like knowing what you excel in, or knowing what sort of lifestyle you would like to live.

Take the time to do quizzes like these: [Know Yourself ](https://www.myskillsfuture.gov.sg/content/student/en/secondary/assessment.html). Just log in (based on which school you are in) and get started to find out about your interests, skills, values and learning styles. 

Take a look at what is available from platforms such as these: [Singapore Industry Landscape](https://www.myskillsfuture.gov.sg/content/student/en/preu/world-of-work/industry-landscape.html) for a better idea of what future roles and responsibilities might suit you. Knowing where you could be headed is a great starting point to planning the steps you will need to take to get there.

Remember that all these tools are here to guide you along and not to instruct you, so answer honestly and don’t feel pressured. Some jobs in the future might not even currently be available yet as the world is always changing!

Publisher: Greenwillow Books, 2017<br>
Also available as an eBook on [NLB OverDrive](https://nlb.overdrive.com/library/teens/media/2948046){:target="_blank" }.

In the real world, Eliza Mirk is shy, weird, and friendless. Online, Eliza is LadyConstellation, anonymous creator of a popular webcomic called Monstrous Sea. With millions of followers and fans throughout the world, Eliza’s persona is popular. Eliza can’t imagine enjoying the real world as much as she loves her digital community.

Then Wallace Warland transfers to her school and Eliza begins to wonder if a life offline might be worthwhile. But when Eliza’s secret is accidentally shared with the world, everything she’s built—her story, her relationship with Wallace, and even her sanity—begins to fall apart.
