<td>When we cook, we often throw away parts of ingredients like vegetable pulp and fruit peels. But did you know that such commonly discarded items can be used in other ways?<br><br>

In this hands-on workshop, you will learn how to make soy milk from scratch. Thereafter, we will teach you how to transform the by-product from making soy milk, a soy pulp known as okara, into other food items like nuggets and cookies. <br><br>
