Think of learning pathways as appetizers. Get started on your learning journey with curated programmes and content before delving deeper into topics that interest you.

Finding time for regular reading is becoming a challenge. Cultivate the reading habit and be a cognizant reader in this age. For budding storytellers, explore the art and techniques of <a href="#storytelling-and-writing">Storytelling and Writing</a>.

<h3><b>Read Well</b></h3>
When kickstarting a habit, start small. Rekindle your reading with recommended short reads, or start reading stories from our own shores with Singapore literature. Besides what to read, understand how our reading brain works, especially in the age of the internet.

        <td>Don Quixote is a reader famously besotted by the classics—the classics of chivalric romances—to be precise. So much does he love them that he goes mad, treating fiction as reality. This delusion thus launches his hilarious and poignant misadventures as a modern-day knight errant. What happens when we treat the world as a text and text as a world? What are the dangers of bibliophilia and bibliomania?<br><br>

				<td><em>Journey to the West</em> (or <em>Xiyou ji</em>) is a celebrated Chinese novel with the beloved Monkey (Sun Wukong), who accompanies a group of pilgrims to retrieve scripture from the West (India). At the end of the novel, after many years and many wanderings, they reach their long-sought after destination—the Thunderclap Monastery of Western Heaven. Yet when they are finally given their scriptures, the pilgrims are utterly dismayed: the scrolls turn out to be blank, “wordless, empty texts”! Why? What moral is the novel trying to impart? How might this correspond with the Buddhist doctrine of emptiness and form?<br><br>

	<td>Doctor Faustus is a perennial legend in European civilisation—the man who sold his soul to the devil. But before that, he was a learned professor in Wittenberg, the birthplace of the Protestant Reformation. What does the myth tell us about the perversions of too much erudition, the temptation of knowledge, the misuses of theology and philosophy? Through a reading of Christopher Marlowe’s play, we’ll think about why it is so difficult for us to be alone, and why having too much power might not be a good thing.<br><br>

				<td><em>The Tempest</em> is Shakespeare’s last play, and many readers take the protagonist Prospero to be a self-portrait of the playwright himself. As the Bard bids farewell to the stage, Prospero at the end of the play drowns in his books and abandons his magical arts. How does the play capture the delicate balance between a noble utopia and rapacious modernity?<br><br>
