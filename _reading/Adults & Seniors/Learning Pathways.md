Think of learning pathways as appetizers. Get started on your learning journey with curated programmes and content before delving deeper into topics that interest you.

Finding time for regular reading is becoming a challenge. Cultivate the reading habit and be a cognizant reader in this age. For budding storytellers, explore the art and techniques of <a href="#storytelling-and-writing">Storytelling and Writing</a>.

<h3><b>Read Well</b></h3>
When kickstarting a habit, start small. Rekindle your reading with recommended short reads, or start reading stories from our own shores with Singapore literature. Besides what to read, understand how our reading brain works, especially in the age of the internet.
