<img style="width:50%" src="/images/reading/preschool/Picture1.png">

Reading is a fundamental life skill in children and is significant in their development of literacy skills. Learning to read starts long before a child enters school and parents play an important role in nurturing children’s passion for reading and life-long learning.
Make reading a fun activity while fostering that special bond between you and your little one, through this suite of reading programmes offered by the public libraries. 
<br><br>Learn how you can develop the 6 pre-reading skills through the simple 5 Early Practices of Reading, Singing, Playing, Talking and Writing via programmes at the libraries.
