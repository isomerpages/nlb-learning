<h5 id="lp-manga" class="margin--bottom--lg"><b>Marvellous Manga</b></h5>

Naruto, One Piece, My Hero Academia, Jujutsu Kaisen – these are just some of the more popular anime series out there. While these series are available in anime or animated format, the basis for their stories were developed from their original manga. “Manga” refers to Japanese comics or graphic novels.  

<h5 ><b>What is manga?</b></h5>

![manga](/images/reading/teens/teensreading_manga1.png)

Manga is an art form that tells a story by using more pictures than words. However, it doesn't mean that texts are entirely overlooked. In fact, texts in the form of narration, dialogue, or sound effect all serve to enhance the reader's experience of the story.   

Unlike the full-coloured pages of most comics we see today, manga is often presented in black and white. It is typically published in manga-based magazines by the different publishers on a weekly or monthly basis. 

Creators of manga are known as “mangaka” and they often both write and illustrate their own works. 

![manga2](/images/reading/teens/teensreading_manga2.png)

If a series becomes popular, its chapters then later get combined into what is called a “tankōbon” - that is, an edition or volume with several chapters in it.

<h5 id="lp-poetry" class="margin--bottom--lg"><b>Teen Things: D.I.Y. Blackout Poetry</b></h5>

Blackout poetry is a form of poetry where an author picks an existing piece of written text and repurposes it into a new poem. This is done by keeping a selection of words, and then *blacking out* the remaining words that’s not needed, giving the written text a different meaning than it had before.
