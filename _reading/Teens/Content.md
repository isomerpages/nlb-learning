Naruto, One Piece, My Hero Academia, Jujutsu Kaisen – these are just some of the more popular anime series out there. While these series are available in anime or animated format, the basis for their stories were developed from their original manga. “Manga” refers to Japanese comics or graphic novels.  
	
<h5 ><b>What is manga?</b></h5>

![manga](/images/reading/teens/teensreading_manga1.png)

Manga is an art form that tells a story through the greater usage of pictures over words. However, it doesn’t mean that text is entirely overlooked. In fact, text in the form of narration, dialogue, or sound effects all serve to enhance the reader's experience of the story.   

Unlike the full-coloured pages of most comics we see today, manga is often presented in black and white. It is typically published in manga-based magazines by the different publishers on a weekly or monthly basis. Creators of manga are known as “mangaka” and they often both write and illustrate their own works.

If a series becomes popular, its chapters then later get combined into what is called a “tankōbon”  that is, an edition or volume with several chapters in it.

<h5 id="manga2" class="margin--bottom--lg"><b>Marvellous Manga (part two)</b></h5>

In part one of our three-part series on the marvellous world of manga, we introduced you to its history and its writers. In part two, we’ll delve into how manga is read and what to read next. 

<h5 ><b>How to read manga? </b></h5>

Unlike books in English that are traditionally read from left to right, manga panels and speech bubbles should be read from right to left. Although the sequence can be confusing when you first start reading manga, you will soon get used to it!

<h5 ><b>What genres are there? </b></h5>

The main genres in manga may not be the ones that you’re familiar with. The usual literary genres, like action, comedy, and science-fiction, are known in the manga world as sub-genres, but not the main genres.  

Instead, manga is typically sorted by how it is marketed to different demographics or age groups.  


Here are some popular genres to note:

<h5 ><b>1. Shojo</b></h5>

Targeted at girls aged 12 to 18, manga of this genre usually centre around the topics of friendship, slice-of-life, and even romance. 
	
![shojo](/images/reading/teens/teensreading_manga-shojo.png)
	
<h5 ><b>2.  Shōnen</b></h5>

Targeted at boys aged 12 to 18, manga of this genre usually have themes of action and adventure. Shōnen is the best-selling genre, with many popular series gaining international fame. 
	
![shonen](/images/reading/teens/teensreading_manga-shonen.png)

<h5 ><b>3. Kodomo </b></h5>

Targeted at children under 12, manga of this genre tend to be episodic, have child-friendly themes, and tell stories that teach readers about the world around them.
