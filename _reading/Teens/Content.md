<h5 id="lp-manga" class="margin--bottom--lg"><b>Marvellous Manga (Part 1)</b></h5>

Naruto, One Piece, My Hero Academia, Jujutsu Kaisen – these are just some of the more popular anime series out there. While these series are available in anime or animated format, the basis for their stories were developed from their original manga. “Manga” refers to Japanese comics or graphic novels.  
	
<h5 ><b>What is manga?</b></h5>

![manga](/images/reading/teens/teensreading_manga1.png)

Manga is an art form that tells a story through the greater usage of pictures over words. However, it doesn’t mean that text is entirely overlooked. In fact, text in the form of narration, dialogue, or sound effects all serve to enhance the reader's experience of the story.   

Unlike the full-coloured pages of most comics we see today, manga is often presented in black and white. It is typically published in manga-based magazines by the different publishers on a weekly or monthly basis. Creators of manga are known as “mangaka” and they often both write and illustrate their own works. 


![manga2](/images/reading/teens/teensreading_manga2.png)

If a series becomes popular, its chapters then later get combined into what is called a “tankōbon”  that is, an edition or volume with several chapters in it.

<h5 ><b>Welcome to the wide, wonderful world of manga!</b></h5>

This is part one of a three-part series on manga. For more resources on this topic, check out NLB’s collection of eBooks [here](https://nlb.overdrive.com/library/teens/search?subject=127&subject=12&sortBy=newlyadded)!

<h5 id="manga2" class="margin--bottom--lg"><b>Marvellous Manga (Part 2)</b></h5>

In part one of our three-part series on the marvellous world of manga, we introduced you to [its history and its writers](https://learning.nlb.gov.sg/reading/teens/content#lp-manga). In part two, we’ll delve into how manga is read and what to read next. 

<h5 ><b>How to read manga? </b></h5>

Unlike books in English that are traditionally read from left to right, manga panels and speech bubbles should be read from right to left. Although the sequence can be confusing when you first start reading manga, you will soon get used to it!  
	
![righttoleft](/images/reading/teens/righttoleft.png)

<h5 ><b>What genres are there? </b></h5>

The main genres in manga may not be the ones that you’re familiar with. The usual literary genres, like action, comedy, and science-fiction, are known in the manga world as sub-genres, but not the main genres.  

Instead, manga is typically sorted by how it is marketed to different demographics or age groups.  


Here are some popular genres to note:

<h5 ><b>1. Shōjo</b></h5>

Targeted at girls aged 12 to 18, manga of this genre usually centre around the topics of friendship, slice-of-life, and even romance. 
	
![shojo](/images/reading/teens/teensreading_manga-shojo.png)
	
<h5 ><b>2.  Shōnen</b></h5>

Targeted at boys aged 12 to 18, manga of this genre usually have themes of action and adventure. Shōnen is the best-selling genre, with many popular series gaining international fame. 
	
![shonen](/images/reading/teens/teensreading_manga-shonen.png)

<h5 ><b>3. Kodomo </b></h5>

Targeted at children under 12, manga of this genre tend to be episodic, have child-friendly themes, and tell stories that teach readers about the world around them.

<h5 id="manga3" class="margin--bottom--lg"><b>Marvellous Manga (Part 3)</b></h5>

In this final part of the series, we will discuss manga in its omnichannel forms.  

Manga’s versatility lends itself to adaptations in a variety of multimedia formats. These different types of adaptations can appeal to different demographics.  

![examples of manga](/images/reading/teens/teensreading_mangaexamples.png)

One such adaptation is anime, which is a style of animation that originates from Japan. It’s rare to discuss manga without also talking about anime, since the former is frequently adapted into the latter. As anime becomes more accessible on popular streaming platforms, it can reach massive audiences and draw new fans into the original manga.  

Popular manga series are sometimes even adapted into live-action dramas and films, where characters are played by human actors instead of illustrated with 2D computer graphics.  

The versatility of manga extends beyond film and television. Franchises can cover a range of products such as merchandise and games, which are developed and marketed to beloved fans. For example, popular series like Naruto and Bleach have seen developers releasing multiple spin-off video games on gaming consoles such as the Wii, Gameboy, and PlayStation. 

In more recent years, manga has even become a basis for mobile games, furthering the original story and its experience in a portable format.  

The adaptation of manga is not always one-directional. Did you know that the renowned Pokémon brand actually started out as a video game series? It has since been serialised as a manga given its commercial success.   

Seeing how versatile and varied manga can be, there’s definitely something for everyone.

This is the story of a man who took a job. Kazuto Tatsuta was an amateur artist who signed onto the dangerous task of cleaning up the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant, which its workers came to call “Ichi-F.” This is the story of that challenging work, of the trials faced by the local citizens, and of the unique camaraderie that built up between the mostly blue-collar workers who had to face the devious and invisible threat of radiation on a daily basis. After six months, Tatsuta’s body had absorbed the maximum annual dose of radiation allowed by regulations, and he was forced to take a break from the work crew, giving him the time to create this unprecedented, unauthorised, award-winning view of daily life at Fukushima Daiichi.
