<h5 id="chinese-culture-and-customs" class="margin--bottom--lg"><b>Playlist: Chinese Customs and Culture</b></h5>

When Chinese immigrants first left their homelands for Singapore in the 1800s in search of jobs and new opportunities, they brought along with them their culture, traditions, and customs to aid in the transition to a new land. These traditions and customs eventually became the foundations of Singapore’s Chinese culture. 

Over the decades, Chinese Singaporeans’ understandings and practice of Chinese culture and customs have evolved along with the cogs of modernisation. While certain practices have vanished with time, some are still practiced today.

<h5 id="lp-chinese-customs-culture" class="margin--bottom--lg"><b> Chinese Customs and Culture</b></h5>

<p>Chinese immigrants first arrived in Singapore from China in the 1800s in search of jobs and new opportunities. Besides a little money and the clothes on their backs, they also brought along with them the culture, traditions, and customs from their homelands to Singapore. 
</p>
<b></b>
<p>Chinese Singaporeans’ knowledge and practice of these culture and customs have evolved alongside Singapore’s modernisation over the decades. While certain practices have vanished with time, some are still in practice. These aspects of tangible and intangible Chinese heritage form a significant part of the Chinese identity in Singapore today.
