<h5 id="chinese-culture-and-customs" class="margin--bottom--lg"><b>Playlist: Chinese Customs and Culture</b></h5>

When Chinese immigrants first left their homelands for Singapore in the 1800s in search of jobs and new opportunities, they brought along with them their culture, traditions, and customs to aid in the transition to a new land. These traditions and customs eventually became the foundations of Singapore’s Chinese culture. 

Over the decades, Chinese Singaporeans’ understandings and practice of Chinese culture and customs have evolved along with the cogs of modernisation. While certain practices have vanished with time, some are still practiced today.

<h5 id="eurasian-culture-and-customs" class="margin--bottom--lg"><b>Playlist: Eurasian Culture and Customs</b></h5>

Eurasians are descendants of hundreds of years of intermarriage between the Europeans and Asians. Majority of Singapore's Eurasians originated from the European colonisation of Asia which began during the 16th century. Most Eurasians in Singapore can trace the European part of their paternal ancestry to primarily the Portuguese, Dutch and British. The Asian component of their maternal ancestry is largely Chinese, Malays, Indians, Thai, Burmese and Indonesian.

Majority of Eurasians in Singapore have Portuguese-Malaccan ancestry, resulting in a strong Portuguese influence in local Eurasian culture.

<p>Chinese immigrants first arrived in Singapore from China in the 1800s in search of jobs and new opportunities. Besides a little money and the clothes on their backs, they also brought along with them the culture, traditions, and customs from their homelands to Singapore. 
</p>
<b></b>
<p>Chinese Singaporeans’ knowledge and practice of these culture and customs have evolved alongside Singapore’s modernisation over the decades. While certain practices have vanished with time, some are still in practice. These aspects of tangible and intangible Chinese heritage form a significant part of the Chinese identity in Singapore today.
