#### **Spinal Tap by Tristan Lim**
**18 August – 26 August 2023**
<br>**10 am – 12 am**
<br>**The Plaza, Level 1, National Library Building** 

**About the installation:**
<br>The basis for *Spinal Tap* is in the book spine, which is often the reader's first encounter of a book when searching in the library. The spine is imagined as a portal, a liminal space where readers immerses in literary worlds, seeking wisdom and fantasy anew. Parallel to the spinal system of vertebrates, both serve as vessels of information, supporting knowledge's flight, as literal foundations for acquiring knowledge. 
	
From afar, *Spinal Tap* presents two large humanoid silhouettes surrounding a spinal-like structure. These bio-mechanical giants engage in silent reading, suspended by ropes in a labyrinthian arrangement. They hold books, resembling the central structure, that seem uncanny at first, but on second glance textual ligatures and strokes can be seen, as they are derived from the titles on book spines used as the basis for *Spinal Tap*. The silhouettes' skin is adorned with imagery extracted from those very same books. These isolated and collaged patterns are fed through an optical flow system, culminating in flowing, intricate and disruptive motifs—a transformation, where literary content takes on tangible form. 
	
The installation forms a written tapestry, woven with circulating ideas. Vein-like ropes embrace the silhouettes, imbibing them with potentiality, evoking notions of evolution and intelligence through the simple act of reading—a deeply human way of learning, filled with untapped potential for so much more.

**About the artist:**
<br>Tristan Lim is a visual artist whose practice explores the material and existential significance of bodily surface and form in contemporary life, surfacing questions on innate perception and desire. Drawing from observations into contemporary visual culture, abstract bodies and chimeric, mutant subjects emerge, often through open-ended narratives, expressed through drawings, installations, new media, and procedural digital works. His work has been featured in group exhibitions at Ota Fine Arts, The Arts House, SAM at 8Q and The Institute of Contemporary Arts Singapore. He has also participated in the Facebook Artist-in-residence (AIR) programme, and presented work in Singapore Night Festival, Light to Night Festival, ART SG, and overseas in Spain, Vietnam &amp; Taiwan.

**Find out more:**
<br>The artist's research journey led him to the rich repository of books on biodiversity at the National Library, culminating in an artwork that drew inspiration from the collection's visual treasures. Skillfully intertwining artistic vision with technology, he harnessed the power of optical flow system and laser-cutting techniques in the creation of his installation, thereby fusing the realms of art and technology into a harmonious whole.

#### **A Stone's Throw (Away) by WY-TO Group**
**19 August – 27 August 2022**
<br>**7.30 pm – 12 am**
<br>**Stamford Walkway** (along Stamford Road, opposite Capitol)

**About the installation:**
<br>*Paddy Fields* &nbsp;recalls the forgotten practice of drying cultivated rice along the banks of Sungei Brass Bassa (now Stamford Canal) in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century. The area was close to the paddy fields located opposite today’s KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital. South Asian washermen and women also laundered clothes there, laying them out to dry on adjacent open space. Using a palette of humble materials, this installation seeks to evoke the sentiments reminiscent of these activities from a bygone era.

Follow the text running along the clusters of rice paddy to trace the story of Bras Basah (which means “wet rice” in Malay) – from its agricultural roots to its history of redevelopment over the years. These quotes are extracted from poems (including “Bras Basah 1953” by Singapore poet Edwin Thumboo) and articles found in the collections of the National Archives of Singapore and National Library.

**About the collective:**
<br>[FARM](https://www.farm.sg){:target="_blank"} is a cross-disciplinary company spanning design, architecture, arts and research.

**About the installation:**
<br>Take a trip down memory lane with this hyper colourful visual treat. Remixing images from the collections of the National Archives of Singapore and National Library, visual artist MOJOKO highlights Singapore’s cinemas of times past. Inspired by the cultural importance and rich visual history of Capitol Theatre and Cathay Picture House, MOJOKO brings a contemporary twist to the classic movie posters that were once commonplace in the area. A moving artwork of epic proportions,&nbsp;*Midnight Show at the Capitol* &nbsp;lights up the walls of the Bras Basah.Bugis precinct in a captivating way.

**About the artist:**
<br>If you are not already familiar with his work, [MOJOKO](https://mojoko.net){:target="_blank"}  is best described as a Pop Art mash-up artist and collage specialist. Often inspired by Singapore’s culture and the energy of living in Southeast Asia, his artworks explore the clashing of cultures, virtual vs. reality, old vs. new, east vs. west.
