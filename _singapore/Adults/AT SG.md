#### **Installation: Spinal Tap**
**18 August – 26 August 2023**
<br>**10 am – 12 am**
<br>**The Plaza, Level 1, National Library Building** 

**About the installation:**
<br>The basis for *Spinal Tap* is in the book spine, which is often the reader's first encounter of a book when searching in the library. The spine is imagined as a portal, a liminal space where readers immerses in literary worlds, seeking wisdom and fantasy anew. Parallel to the spinal system of vertebrates, both serve as vessels of information, supporting knowledge's flight, as literal foundations for acquiring knowledge.
<br>From afar, *Spinal Tap* presents two large humanoid silhouettes surrounding a spinal-like structure. These bio-mechanical giants engage in silent reading, suspended by ropes in a labyrinthian arrangement. They hold books, resembling the central structure, that seem uncanny at first, but on second glance textual ligatures and strokes can be seen, as they are derived from the titles on book spines used as the basis for *Spinal Tap*. The silhouettes' skin is adorned with imagery extracted from those very same books. These isolated and collaged patterns are fed through an optical flow system, culminating in flowing, intricate and disruptive motifs—a transformation, where literary content takes on tangible form.
<br>The installation forms a written tapestry, woven with circulating ideas. Vein-like ropes embrace the silhouettes, imbibing them with potentiality, evoking notions of evolution and intelligence through the simple act of reading—a deeply human way of learning, filled with untapped potential for so much more.

**About the artist:**
<br>Tristan Lim is a visual artist whose practice explores the material and existential significance of bodily surface and form in contemporary life, surfacing questions on innate perception and desire. Drawing from observations into contemporary visual culture, abstract bodies and chimeric, mutant subjects emerge, often through open-ended narratives, expressed through drawings, installations, new media, and procedural digital works. His work has been featured in group exhibitions at Ota Fine Arts, The Arts House, SAM at 8Q and The Institute of Contemporary Arts Singapore. He has also participated in the Facebook Artist-in-residence (AIR) programme, and presented work in Singapore Night Festival, Light to Night Festival, ART SG, and overseas in Spain, Vietnam and Taiwan.

**Find out more:**
<br>The artist's research journey led him to the rich repository of books on biodiversity at the National Library, culminating in an artwork that drew inspiration from the collection's visual treasures. Skillfully intertwining artistic vision with technology, he harnessed the power of optical flow system and laser-cutting techniques in the creation of his installation, thereby fusing the realms of art and technology into a harmonious whole.

#### **Installation: A Stone's Throw (Away)**
**18 August – 26 August 2023**
<br>**7.30 pm – 12 am**
<br>**Banyan Tree, National Museum of Singapore** 

**About the installation:**
<br>*A Stone's Throw (Away)* is inspired by the legend of the Singapore Stone. Recorded in the Sejarah Melayu (Malay Annals), the stone was flung from Fort Canning Hill to the mouth of the Singapore River by 14th-century strongman Badang, who would have made a fine shot put athlete today. In 1843, the British removed the colossal stone to widen the river's passage. This light installation reimagines the stone through a series of interconnected light panels filled with illustrations that are illuminated with body movement. Gather fellow festival-goers in front of the panels to activate them, and watch the “reconstructed” relic come to life.

**About the artist:**
<br>WY-TO Group doesn’t merely envision urban landscapes and create experiential spaces; they’re also the connoisseur of the visual splendour, culture, and heritage that inhabit them. True to their philosophy, “Design with A Cause”, they put the needs of the people and the environment on a pedestal, conjuring solutions to create an ecosystem that is inclusive, resilient, and free from the stresses of urban living.

**Behind the work:**
<br>In exploring the stories within Singapore and more specifically within the Bras Basah &amp; Bugis district, we looked at the legend of Badang and the Singapore Stone as the starting point of inspiration for our work. The legend of Badang is a popular childhood story that originated from the Sejarah Melayu (Malay Annals), which has been translated into a movie in 1962 and was even featured in Singapore’s National Day Parade in 2016.
<br>The story of the Singapore Stone serves as an analogy of the precinct of Bras Basah &amp; Bugis. Indeed, it was previously the centre of governance for the progress of trade in Singapore from the 14th century till the 19th century when British set up a free port. Moreover, it is within this precinct that different types of businesses, residents, schools, entertainment and legends thrive to create a distinctive and diverse community. However, many of these distinctive elements were displaced by the urban renewal which started in the 70s. The multi-facetted installation aims to recall, rejoin and celebrate these diverse communities together.
<br>Similarly, the surviving fragment of the stone currently on display at the National Museum of Singapore serves as a reminder of the strong roots of the Nation that set the foundation of its development. Nevertheless, to this day linguists are still unable to decipher the inscription on the fragmented piece, which could hold secrets to Singapore’s history.
<br>The narrative of the installation, the reconstructed Singapore Stone, thus aims to serve as a cultural reminder of Singapore’s past as a historical Great Port City by connecting visitors to the story and the precinct.
