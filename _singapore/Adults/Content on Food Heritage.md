<p> Eurasian food has a history that goes back to the 16th century. Eurasian families emerged from various trading ports in the region, such as Malacca, Penang, Goa, Macau, Ceylon and Bencoolen, where Europeans settled and had children with local women.

<h5 class="margin--bottom--lg" id="lp-chinese-cuisine"><b>Singapore's Food Heritage: Chinese Cuisine</b></h5>

<p> In Singapore, majority of the early Chinese migrants came from the southern Chinese provinces of Guangzhou and Fujian. Guangdong cuisine like the cantonese, teochew and hakka dishes use steaming, poaching, braising, or simmering to bring out the natural flavour of each ingredient in the dish. Fujian cuisine also has several styles ranging from light, mild sweet and sour taste to more intense flavour with the use of sugar and spices. The Hainanese who arrived in Singapore much later, also brought with them their own special dishes.

<p>“Rendang is a popular dish made with meat stewed in coconut milk and spices. Commonly found in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, the dish has a long history in the region with distinct versions unique to individual Malaysian states. The different versions of rendang use different ingredients for the rempah (Malay for “spice mix”), thus resulting in differing flavours to the meat.” </p>

<h5 class="margin--bottom--lg" id="lp-indian-cuisine"><b>Singapore's Food Heritage: Indian Cuisine</b></h5>

<p> The roots of Indian food heritage lead us back to centuries-old traditions and take us across different parts of the Indian sub-continent region. Just the south Indian dishes in Singapore alone can be attributed to multiple origins such as the states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra, Telengana and Karnataka, with each region offering the promise of a different flavour. A common Indian favourite such as curry is not going to taste the same in each of these states. But when all these region-specific recipes met at colonial Singapore, it gave birth to the island’s very own uniquely Singaporean Indian cuisine. The interactions from the Chinese, Malay and European cuisines enhanced its uniqueness even further.

<li> Eating on banana leaves not only make the dishes look more colourful and appealing, it also enhances the taste of the dish. When hot rice is served on the leaf, it absorbs the healthy compounds and unique flavour of the leaf. Banana leaves are waterproof too! Indian dishes, which are mostly accompanied with gravies, chutneys and ghee, are not going to stick to the leaf. This provides us with the fullest dining experience. After the meal, closing the leaf inwards demonstrates a feeling of gratefulness towards the host, so always remember to fold correctly! </li>

		<li>According to recent studies, consumer demand for ready-to-eat (RTE) food will be seeing a significant rise in Singapore in the next five years. As Singaporeans are allocating less time to cooking food at home and seeking out health-conscious meals, the growing demand for quick food that is fresh and nutritious has seen the emergence of many local food brands providing pre-cleaned, pre-cooked, and ready for consumption packaged food. Prima Taste is one such local brand which has emerged among top five RTE brands in Singapore, competing with well-known international names such as Nestle and Kellogg’s.</li>
