<h5 id="lp-eurasian-cuisine" class="margin--bottom--lg"><b>Eurasian Cuisine</b></h5>
<p> Eurasian food has a history that goes back to the 16th century. Eurasian families emerged from various trading ports in the region, such as Malacca, Penang, Goa, Macau, Ceylon and Bencoolen, where Europeans settled and had children with local women. Many of these Eurasians would later settle in Singapore at different times. Their cuisine blends European and Asian ingredients and techniques.

<h5 id="lp-Chinese-cuisine" class="margin--bottom--lg"><b>Chinese Cuisine</b></h5>

<p> In Singapore, majority of the early Chinese migrants came from the southern Chinese provinces of Guangzhou and Fujian. Guangdong cuisine like the cantonese, teochew and hakka dishes use steaming, poaching, braising, or simmering to bring out the natural flavour of each ingredient in the dish. Fujian cuisine also has several styles ranging from light, mild sweet and sour taste to more intense flavour with the use of sugar and spices. The Hainanese who arrived in Singapore much later, also brought with them their own special dishes.

<p>With many Malays being seafaring people in the past, their diet was typically pescatarian. Malay cuisine has developed to incorporate other ingredients and culinary techniques because of cultural exchanges between the Malay Archipelago and the rest of the world.

</a></h5>
<p>“Ketupat is a diamond-shaped rice cake. This Malay food staple is made of cooked rice compressed and wrapped in woven coconut leaves. Originating from Indonesia and Malaysia, ketupat is often consumed as an accompaniment to meat dishes such as satay (skewered barbecued meat) or stews, although the traditional version has become less common in Singapore. It is served during special occasions such as Hari Raya Puasa and Malay weddings, but can also be eaten during regular meals.”</p>
