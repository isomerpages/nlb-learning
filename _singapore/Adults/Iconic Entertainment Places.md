<p> This 2-volume thesis studies the three “Worlds” entertainment parks. Tan argued that the parks were sites of mass consumption that “transgressed entrenched class and ethnic boundaries of the colonial public sphere.” Volume I has nine chapters while Volume II consists of illustrations such as figures, maps, and building plans.</p>

<p>“Glitz, glamour, and sleaze is what people may remember of the cabaret girls of yesteryear. With curiosity and an open mind, Adeline Foo sets out to uncover the lives of these women and how, even with few dreams and hopes to strive for, these women lived with much heart and courage despite society's disapproving eye. The music of the dance hall may have faded away, but this book carries the echoes of their dance steps, connecting us with a forgotten past that was inspired by faith, hope and charity.”</p>
