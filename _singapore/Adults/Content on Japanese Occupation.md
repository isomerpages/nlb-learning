<p> The fall of Singapore on 15 February 1942 in the Second World War is, as Winston Churchill put it, ‘the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history’. </p>

<h5 id="lp-aftermath-of-war" class="margin--bottom--lg"><b> Japanese Occupation: Liberation and Aftermath of War </b></h5>

<p> Japanese surrender in 1945 led to widespread jubilation. British military administration was soon set up to restore law and order during the immediate post-war period. Singapore faced severe food shortages, unemployment, overcrowded living conditions and insufficient healthcare. 
</p>
<b></b>
<p> Dissatisfaction with the British government and a series of factors led to the political awakening amongst emerging young leaders with rising anti-colonial and nationalist sentiments. Violent unrests with labour and student riots, communal tensions and inter-ethnic conflicts marked the next two decades after the war.</p>
