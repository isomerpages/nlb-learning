As a compromise, they would only send their main battle fleet from the Atlantic to the Asia-Pacific when a threat was imminent. This was known as the Singapore Strategy".<br><br>

<h5 id="lp-fall-of-singapore"> <b> Japanese Occupation: Fall of Singapore </b></h5>
<p> The fall of Singapore on 15 February 1942 in the Second World War is, as Winston Churchill put it, ‘the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history’. </p>
<b></b>
<p> Since 1942, there has been a steady flow of books and articles on this subject. Earlier works focused on the conduct of the military campaign, but as the archives started opening their records, the focus has shifted to the broader issues of strategy and international relations.</p>
<h4>Did you know...</h4>
<ul>
<li> Total Defence Day was launched in 1984 and commemorated on 15th February every year. It marks the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942 and serves as a reminder for every Singapore to play a part in building a strong, secure and cohesive nation.</li>
<b></b>
<li> These curated set of articles and books shed lights on the historic event.</li>
