<h5 class="margin--bottom--lg" id="lp-shophouses"><b>Shophouses</b></h5>

<p>The shophouse is a two-to-five -storey terraced building which is characterized by the upper floors extending out at the front of the building, creating a sheltered veranda. Mainly constructed between the 1840s and 1960s, the shophouse was a major building type particularly in Singapore s historic districts. As the shophouses were terraced buildings, meaning that it shared walls with the neighbouring buildings to either side, the verandas could be linked together for pedestrians to use. The veranda, known as the  five-footway,  was also a space that was often used by peddlers, hawkers, and itinerant craftsmen to conduct business.</p>

<p> The dimensions of the shophouse was primarily influenced by building regulations (ordinances) and district planning for the period. Shophouses were usually long (18 to 20 meters in length) and narrow (usually 6 meters or less) and did not originally have modern amenities such as flush toilets. Many commercial shophouses initially used the ground floor as a business premise and the back of the shophouse or its upper floors for residential purposes. Some shophouses were residential, while others were used for club and association gatherings, or even as brothels. Shophouses may also be found in other Southeast Asian cities  historic districts, particularly in former Straits Settlements places like Melaka and Penang, and even as far away as certain coastal cities in southern China, due to building regulations, trading networks, and historic population movements. In Singapore, shophouses generally fall into six styles and must follow conservation guidelines set by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA). Some shophouse rows have been redeveloped as boutique hotels.</p>

<p>In his 1822 master Town Plan, Sir Stamford Raffles allocated the whole area west of the Singapore River for a Chinese settlement known as the Chinese Campong (kampong in Malay means  village ), envisaging that the Chinese would form the bulk of future town dwellers. Singapore, the new land of opportunity then, had attracted many immigrants from China, who expanded the original boundaries of this economically and culturally vibrant, self-contained town. </p>

<p> Cairnhill was named after Charles Carnie, whose house was built on Carnie Hill around 1840. The area was later renamed Cairn Hill, and Carnie s house inspired the names Cairnhill Circle, Cairnhill Rise, and Cairnhill Road. The Residential Historic District of Cairnhill broadly refers to the areas around Cairnhill Road, which connects Scotts Road and Orchard Road. Notable landmarks include the Tan Chin Tuan Mansion, Cairnhill Arts Centre, two-storey terrace houses, and Al-Falah Mosque.</p>
