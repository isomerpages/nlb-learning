<h5 class="margin--bottom--lg" id="vanishing-trades"><b>Playlist: Five-Foot-Way Traders</b></h5>
The term “five-foot-way” refers to the veranda area in front of shophouses. During the colonial period, due to the lack of available jobs, some immigrants to Singapore set up small one-person businesses in these areas, selling food items—such as street hawkers and the kacang putih man—or services—such as letter writers, cobblers, and street barbers. There were also entertainers, such as snake charmers. As Singapore grew to become more industrialized in the 1970s and these tradesmen grew older, some trades started to sunset due to a lack of successors, a lack of interest in the profession, and/or low income. Other street trades moved into proper premises.

Check out these resources to help you gain some understanding of the five-foot-way traders in Singapore.

<p><b> The Bygone Age Of Letter Writing In Old Singapore | A Frame In Time 2 | Full Episode (48 mins)
</b>
<br>This show helmed by filmmaker Kelvin Tong uses Ong Kim Seng’s painting of the 'Night Calligrapher’ to set the scene of what the age of letter writing was like. It intermixes a short fictional story as well as interviews with the artist, academics, the son of a letter writer, and a ma jie, among others. “Letter writers played the important role of helping Singapore’s migrant forefathers write letters to their loved ones in their city of birth. They also doubled as calligraphers for Chinese New Year couplets and ancestral altars.” There are segments of the video with English subtitles.<br><br>

<p><a href=[https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP\_105\_2005-01-04.html](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_105_2005-01-04.html)\> Five-foot-way traders </a> were largely craftsmen who conducted their businesses along covered shophouse walkways. The name “five-foot-way” refers to the original stipulation that the walkways be five feet wide. The walkways, which originated in Malaya during the early 19th century, were meant to protect pedestrians from the elements. Due to the movement of peoples throughout the 19th-20th century, this architectural feature can be found in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, and China.</p>

<p>In Singapore, the five-foot-way traders engaged in trading inexpensive commodities (such as selling newspapers or food items)—and services (this included roadside barbers, shoe shining, locksmiths, fortune tellers, letter writing, traditional medicine healing, and knife sharpening to name a few). These trades started propping up when the influx of migrants to Singapore found it difficult to find work. Some began to use the corridors to set up these small businesses and paid rent to the shopkeeper. By the mid-1970s, as Singapore became more industrialized and these traders became older, some of these trades were either in decline or had moved into proper retail areas. </p>

<p>Fiona Lim explores the colourful history of the five-foot-way and the trades that went on there. The article depicts how the certain shophouse quarters became specialized for certain trades—Kampong Glam’s five-foot-ways specialized in Islamic trades; Chinatown’s five-foot-ways hosted Chinese calligraphers and letter writers; and Little India’s five-foot-ways was the site for Indian parrot astrologers, for example.</p>
