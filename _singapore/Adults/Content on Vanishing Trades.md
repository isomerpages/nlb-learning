<h5 class="margin--bottom--lg" id="vanishing-trades"><b>Playlist: Five-Foot Way Traders</b></h5>
The term “five-foot-way” refers to the veranda area in front of shophouses. During the colonial period, due to the lack of available jobs, some immigrants to Singapore set up small one-person businesses in these areas, selling food items—such as street hawkers and the kacang putih man—or services—such as letter writers, cobblers, and street barbers. There were also entertainers, such as snake charmers. As Singapore grew to become more industrialized in the 1970s and these tradesmen grew older, some trades started to sunset due to a lack of successors, a lack of interest in the profession, and/or low income. Other street trades moved into proper premises.

Check out these resources to help you gain some understanding of the five-foot-way traders in Singapore.

<p><b> The Bygone Age Of Letter Writing In Old Singapore | A Frame In Time 2 | Full Episode (48 mins)
</b>
<br>This show helmed by filmmaker Kelvin Tong uses Ong Kim Seng’s painting of the 'Night Calligrapher’ to set the scene of what the age of letter writing was like. It intermixes a short fictional story as well as interviews with the artist, academics, the son of a letter writer, and a ma jie, among others. “Letter writers played the important role of helping Singapore’s migrant forefathers write letters to their loved ones in their city of birth. They also doubled as calligraphers for Chinese New Year couplets and ancestral altars.” There are segments of the video with English subtitles.<br><br>
