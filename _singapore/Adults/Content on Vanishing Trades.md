<h5 id="five-foot-way-traders" class="margin--bottom--lg"><b>Playlist: Five-Foot-Way Traders</b></h5>
The term “five-foot-way” refers to the veranda area in front of shophouses. During the colonial period, due to the lack of available jobs, some immigrants to Singapore set up small one-person businesses in these areas, selling food items—such as street hawkers and the kacang putih man—or services—such as letter writers, cobblers, and street barbers. There were also entertainers, such as snake charmers. As Singapore grew to become more industrialized in the 1970s and these tradesmen grew older, some trades started to sunset due to a lack of successors, a lack of interest in the profession, and/or low income. Other street trades moved into proper premises.

Check out these resources to help you gain some understanding of the five-foot-way traders in Singapore.

<p><b> The Bygone Age Of Letter Writing In Old Singapore | A Frame In Time 2 | Full Episode (48 mins)
</b>
<br>This show helmed by filmmaker Kelvin Tong uses Ong Kim Seng’s painting of the 'Night Calligrapher’ to set the scene of what the age of letter writing was like. It intermixes a short fictional story as well as interviews with the artist, academics, the son of a letter writer, and a ma jie, among others. “Letter writers played the important role of helping Singapore’s migrant forefathers write letters to their loved ones in their city of birth. They also doubled as calligraphers for Chinese New Year couplets and ancestral altars.” There are segments of the video with English subtitles.<br><br>

Cottage industries are small-scale, family-run businesses typically producing goods and services of cultural significance. Cottage industries are different from other small enterprises in that their owners are directly engaged in production, which is traditionally labour-intensive and involves specialised skill. While machinery may be used to support production, the goods made by cottage industries remain primarily handcrafted. Examples include traditional food, furniture, jewellery, clothing, and religious items. What are some of the cottage industries in our midst? How have they survived through the years and what challenges confront them today? Watch the videos below to find out more.

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_105_2005-01-04.html"> Five-foot-way traders </a> were largely craftsmen who conducted their businesses along covered shophouse walkways. The name “five-foot-way” refers to the original stipulation that the walkways be five feet wide. The walkways, which originated in Malaya during the early 19th century, were meant to protect pedestrians from the elements. Due to the movement of peoples throughout the 19th-20th century, this architectural feature can be found in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, and China.</p>

<p>In Singapore, the five-foot-way traders engaged in trading inexpensive commodities (such as selling newspapers or food items)—and services (this included roadside barbers, shoe shining, locksmiths, fortune tellers, letter writing, traditional medicine healing, and knife sharpening to name a few). These trades started propping up when the influx of migrants to Singapore found it difficult to find work. Some began to use the corridors to set up these small businesses and paid rent to the shopkeeper. By the mid-1970s, as Singapore became more industrialized and these traders became older, some of these trades were either in decline or had moved into proper retail areas. </p>

<p> Cottage industries are small-scale, family-run businesses typically producing goods and services of cultural significance. Cottage industries are unique in that their owners are often directly engaged in day-to-day operations and management decisions. Then, the production process is labour-intensive and requires artisanal skills. While machinery may be used, the goods made by cottage industries are still mainly handcrafted.
</p>
<b></b>
<p> Cottage industries in Singapore have come under pressure over the decades as the economy shifted towards capital-intensive, knowledge-based industries. Factors like rising costs and difficulty of finding suitable labour add to the challenge of survival. That said, some businesses in Singapore that started as cottage industries have successfully expanded and modernised their operations - even extending their footprint abroad.

<p> This article introduces the practice of traditional handmade gold jewellery in Indian culture. The trade is typically family-run and is usually passed down from father to son or other male kin. The goldsmith crafts the jewellery completely by hand, melting the gold over a small burner and shaping it with tools such as tweezers. In its heyday in the 1950s, there were some 500 Indian goldsmiths in Singapore and their shops were mainly located in the Buffalo Road area.</p>
