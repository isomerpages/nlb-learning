<h5 class="margin--bottom--lg" id="national-symbols"><b>Playlist: National Symbols – Building a Nation</b></h5>

Singapore’s National Symbols are one of the country’s earliest nation building tools. The first three symbols – the National Flag, State Crest, and National Anthem – were revealed during the installation of Encik Yusof bin Ishak as the first Malayan-born Yang di Pertuan Negara (Head of State) on 3 December 1959. They intend to unite all Singaporeans as one people and reflect our values as a nation.

<p> On 3 December 1959, Singapore’s first three National Symbols – the National Flag, State Crest, and National Anthem – were unveiled during the installation of Encik Yusof bin Ishak as the first Malayan-born Yang di Pertuan Negara (Head of State). It would mark an important point in Singapore’s path to independence and the start of our journey in forging a sense of national identity.</p>

<p>As a nation made up of people from different races, classes and backgrounds, our National Symbols aim to rally our diverse communities together as one people. Imbued with their own meanings and values, the symbols also express our nation’s hopes and ideals. In the 1980s, new symbols, like the Lion Head symbol and National Flower, were created to continue the ever-important task of fostering national pride and identity.</p>
