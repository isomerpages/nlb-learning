<h5 class="margin--bottom--lg" id="lp-green-econ" ><b>The Many Names of Singapore </b></h5>
<p>We probably are familiar with the variant names of Singapore such as Temasek and Singapura today. Back in the 17<sup>th</sup> to early 19<sup>th</sup> century, Singapore was identified as a promontory, a strait, a ridge, an island, as well as a settlement, based on naming conventions on cartographical references that have been documented.<sup><a href="#footnote-five">1</a></sup> For Singaporeans, this is a nation we associate with, and a place we call home. This learning package offers some trivia to the variant names of Singapore from early records.</p>
