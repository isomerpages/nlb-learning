**Start a Learning Community**

Got a special interest or a skill you’d like to share? Ready to start something new and watch it grow? If you’d love to be part of a Learning Community but can’t find one that fits your interests, consider starting one of your own! 

Here’s what to expect when starting your own Learning Community: 

*What you’ll do:*

**Get together:** Each Learning Community should have a core group of a recommended 4-6 members. If your group needs more members to get started, we can support you in running a few one-off events to grow your group and get the word out!

**Meet up:**  Learning Communities meet regularly to share their knowledge, practise a skill, or just chat about their chosen subject.

**Be open:**
All our Learning Communities are free and open to the public. Knowledge in your group should be shared unconditionally, and without any strings attached!  


**Be welcoming:**
Libraries are public places and everyone should feel safe and welcome here! People learn best and connect meaningfully when they are in spaces where they feel they can be themselves without judgement. Encourage your group to express themselves with kindness and curiosity! 

*What we’ll do:*

**Make space for you:**
We provide space in our public libraries to all our Learning Communities. We also provide basic equipment, including chairs, tables, and writing materials.

**Provide guidance:** 
Although Learning Communities are largely self-directed by its members, our friendly librarians will be on hand to advise and support you and your community when necessary. 


**Get the word out:** All Learning Communities will be listed on the Learning Communities website for prospective members to read about and join. We’ll also keep you informed about other opportunities to publicise as and when they come up.
