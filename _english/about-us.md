A Learning community (LC) is a bridge between curious people, a modern kampong of communal learning. 

Learning communities bring people with common interests together to interact, learn, and bond regularly through the sharing of knowledge by people from our communities. 

People just like you. 

Our intention is to connect you to an interest group, or to empower you start your own. 
Learning communities are for everyone. 

Now - What do you want to learn?
