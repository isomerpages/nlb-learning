**Join a Learning Community**

Our Learning Communities cover a wide range of interests and meet in libraries all over Singapore. 

Find a Learning Community that best suits your needs! 

You can view them sorted by subject, location, or target age group.  

If you can’t find a Learning Community to join, why not start your own?



**How to Join**

Head to GoLibrary to register for upcoming sessions of your chosen Learning Community.
