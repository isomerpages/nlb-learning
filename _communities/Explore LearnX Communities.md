## **More the merrier**

Sharing knowledge and exchanging ideas with people who have similar interests as you makes learning so much more rewarding. That’s why LearnX Communities connect like-minded people to create a modern kampong of communal learning.
 
These communities cover a wide range of topics and can be found in libraries all over the island.

      <h5 class="margin--top--sm margin--bottom--sm"><b>Chatbot Learning Community</b></h5>
      <p class="margin--top--sm margin--bottom--sm">This community was created in partnership with ai4impact for anyone and everyone interested in chatbot technology. The first challenge was to create a Librarian Chatbot to recommend books to NLB’s patrons. Participants were supported with virtual masterclasses, a DIY coding crash course and even a helpline on Telegram where they could brainstorm solutions with the entire community.</p>

      <h5 class="margin--top--sm margin--bottom--sm"><b>Comics x Nature</b></h5>
      <p class="margin--top--sm margin--bottom--sm">The Comics X Nature Learning Community is made up of those who use comics as a way to express their love for nature and the environment. Through this unique medium, participants hope to spread their message and learn from each other. To date, the community has had the opportunity to learn from artist and illustrator Alan Bay, as well as comic artist Sonia Yeo. An anthology of the community’s works on environmental issues will soon be produced and made available for loan at public libraries and online.</p>

      <p class="margin--top--sm margin--bottom--sm">This community is made up of creators who produce Zines. Pronounced “zeens”, these are self-published magazines produced in small batches. There are no rules as to what makes a zine, and that is possibly their biggest charm.</p>
