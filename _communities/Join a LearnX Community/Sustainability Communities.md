      <p class="margin--top--sm margin--bottom--sm">We have all heard of the garden city – but what about the library garden? <br>
Give your (green) fingers a break from thumbing through our books and let’s roll up our sleeves for a session of Community Gardening in our very own library’s backyard! 
Be sure to dress for the occasion, with gardening-ready clothes. Don’t forget to bring along drinking water, mosquito repellent, and a healthy dose of sunblock!<br><br>
For teens, adults and seniors, conducted in English at Queenstown Public Library.</p>

      <p class="margin--top--sm margin--bottom--sm">The Nature Club aspires to be an intergenerational book club (for all ages), creating a space for the discussion of ecological narratives.<br>
Collective calamities like the climate crisis - among others - often inflict wounds of ecological grief, hurt and isolation on all of us, and stories provide a language and medium of catharsis and healing for everyone who wishes to join our sessions.  <br><br>
For all ages, conducted monthly in English at Central Public Library.<br>
