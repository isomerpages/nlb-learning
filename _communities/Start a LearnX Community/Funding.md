Welcome to our Funding Support page!

To support existing Learning Communities as well as grow new ones, NLB will provide each group with a token sum for the purchasing of consumables that will aid directly in enhancing the learning experience and the learning activities of its members. Hereâ€™s a quick overview of what to expect.

Learning Communities are highly encouraged to utilise the existing equipment and facilities in NLB e.g. MakeIT venues, programme spaces, music studio etc.
