It is never too early to teach children about sustainability and the importance of caring for our environment. Although this might be a broad topic, there are plenty of ways to teach young children about sustainability in a way that they can understand. 

As a start, we can tell them ways to protect the environment by practising the three Rs: reduce, reuse and recycle.

Check out the video resources below to help your child understand more about the three Rs and how to take care of the environment.
