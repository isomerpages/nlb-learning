In the last decade, the boom of social media sites and music streaming platforms has made listening to music more accessible than ever before. 

With a swipe or a click, we’re able to conveniently discover virtually any type of music we desire. Here are some of the notable changes that have happened:<br>
<img style="width: 70%;" alt="For consumers: Streaming platforms, such as Spotify and Apple Music, make use of algorithms to curate personalised playlists for their consumers. These playlists help consumers to discover new music based on their preferences and listening habits." src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-mxt4.png"><br>
<img style="width: 70%;" alt="For artists: With social media platforms connecting artists directly to their audience, artists are able to bypass music labels who traditionally manage the distribution and promotion of their music. This gives artists more freedom of control over their own craft." src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-mxt5.png"><br>
<img style="width: 70%;" alt="For live performances: Tech innovations introduce new layers to live performances, turning the gig experience from a traditionally aural event to a multi-sensory one. This includes virtual reality concerts and livestreamed shows that you can watch from the comfort of your home." src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-mxt6.png">

Creating music twenty years ago was done very differently from the way it’s created today.

Musicians can write, record, and mix their own music from a laptop, rather than waiting to make it big through more traditional means. This guide takes readers through real-world career advice, and some of the career paths that can be explored by the music and technology savvy.

**Music: A Very Short Introduction**<br>
Author: Nicholas Cook<br>
Publisher: Oxford University Press, 2021<br>
Only available as an eBook on [NLB OverDrive](https://nlb.overdrive.com/media/6081119). 

The world teems with different kinds of music—traditional, folk, classical, jazz, rock, pop—and each type of music tends to come with its own way of thinking. Drawing on a wealth of accessible examples ranging from Beethoven to Chinese zither music, this *Very Short Introduction* considers the history of music and thinking about music, focusing on its social and cultural dimensions. 

In this new edition Cook explores the impact of digital technology on the production and consumption of music, including how it has transformed participatory music-making and the music business. He also discusses music's position in a globalized world, from the role it played in historical processes of colonisation and decolonisation to its present-day significance as a vehicle of cross-cultural communication.
