<h1>Learning Package: Digital Creation</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>What is digital creation? To put it simply, digital creation is the process of creating a work, a product or a tool using digital technology. Digital creation can range from simple actions like snapping a photo with your phone or writing a blog post, to more advanced ones like creating digital art and engaging in digital making such as 3D printing and digital cutting.
To help you understand and learn more about digital creations, do check out the resources that we have compiled here.
