<p> When we think of everyday science, we might picture the obvious — electricity which keeps appliances running, potted plants which undergo photosynthesis, and so on. But what about video games? </p>

<p> Many video games are full of scientific elements. Take the popular game Animal Crossing: New Horizons, for example. In this game, you can fill your day-to-day activities with crafting, trading, and even crossbreeding flowers.</p>

<p> According to players, this crossbreeding algorithm mimics Mendelian inheritance (Source: <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/technology/the-hidden-science-behind-2020s-biggest-video-games">Discover Magazine</a>, 2020), whereby various traits such as a flower’s colour are a result of a mix of dominant and recessive alleles (Source: <a href="https://blog.science.edu.sg/2020/07/23/animal-crossing/">I Saw the Science</a>, 2020).</p>

<p>Even Pokémon’s creators were inspired by theories of evolution and parasitism. Check out this video on how science makes an appearance in this beloved game:</p>

Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xGvvulC1EDk">Pokemon &amp; Science, Did You Know Gaming?</a>
	
<p>But there’s a bigger way science is present in almost all games. It forms one of the foundational elements a game is built on — its physics.</p>
	
<p>While gaming, if you’ve ever thrown an object or flown through the air, you might have experienced a game’s physics engine in play. This engine is a programme which creates a simulation of how objects move based on the laws of physics.</p>
	
<p>One of the more popular effects that game engines simulate is something called rigid body dynamics. According to <a href="https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Engineering/Courses/En4/notes_old/RigidKinematics/rigkin.htm">Brown University</a>, rigid body dynamics is “an idealisation of a body that does not deform or change shape.” </p>
	
<p>Simply put, it is the way in which solid and inflexible objects move. Humans, pets, buses, and trains are all examples of rigid bodies. </p>
	
<p>Rigid body dynamics can be simulated using the basis of Newton’s laws of motion: the law of inertia, the law of mass and acceleration, and the law of motion (Source: <a href="https://www.toptal.com/game/video-game-physics-part-i-an-introduction-to-rigid-body-dynamics">Toptal</a> , 2015).</p>
	
<p>Using these laws, various differential equations determined by forces and geometry can be created (Source: <a href="https://www.myphysicslab.com/">My Physics Lab</a>). The physics engine then uses these equations to generate iterations of object movement, such as a car moving or a cat walking. </p>

<p>Take a look at this video to see how physics is utilised when building a racing game:</p>

Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xz8RRxYwrhg">The Physics of Racing Games, Real Engineering</a> 

<p>So, why isn’t physics always realistic in gameplay? First, it’s impossible to perfectly simulate real-world physics — there are just too many factors that can’t be accounted for. Second, a physics-defying game makes for more exciting gameplay.</p>

<p>In the game Portal, you’re able to use a gun to create portals which you or objects can travel through. Over the years, questions from players have been emerging on how the laws of physics would fare through teleportation. Can you solve one of these paradoxes?</p>

**Introduction** <br>
How do we see things around us? Light! Let us watch a video that will teach us more about light.

[<img src="/images/science/Teens/light dr binocs.png" alt="youtube" style="width: 100%" align="left">](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7yTlp4gBTI)
Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7yTlp4gBTI">Light | The Dr. Binocs Show | Learn Videos For Kids</a>

Everything in life is dependent on light. Plants need light to carry out photosynthesis, while humans need natural light to help us produce Vitamin D and regulate our sleep patterns. Light also enables us to see the beauty of the world around us!

Fun fact: Do you know the word ‘photograph’ evolved from the ancient Greek words ‘phot-’ which means ‘light’ and ‘graph-’ which means writing? So essentially, the word ‘photograph’ means writing with light!

Here are three fun activities below that you can carry out at home to explore more about light and its fascinating properties.

**Activity 1. Visualising Laser Light with Water Mist**
![](/images/science/Teens/the%20path%20of%20a%20laser.png)

**Background** <br>
Have you ever wondered how light travels? In this activity, let us observe light and how it travels through a water mist.

Suggested: If you are unable to find the materials needed at home, watch the video below and read more about the science behind it under ‘Science Time!’.

Materials

●      1 Laser pointer

●      Water

●      1 Spray bottle (e.g. empty hand sanitiser spray bottle)

**Steps**

1. Switch on the laser pointer and shine it at a blank surface (e.g. a wall) in front of you. (Be careful not to shine the laser pointer into your eyes or the eyes of those around you!) What do you observe?
2. Fill up the spray bottle with water.
3. Shine the laser pointer on the wall and get a friend to help to spray water using a spray bottle along the path taken by the laser.
![](/images/science/Teens/image005.png)

What do you notice this time?

**Science Time!** <br>
Did you observe this?
[<img src="/images/science/Teens/laser wall.png" alt="Laser" style="width: 100%" align="left">](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Eay2CgCi4sA?feature=shares/)
<br>


**Why are we only able to observe the laser as a dot on the wall but unable to see the beam of laser initially?**
![](/images/science/Teens/observe%20laser.png)
A unique property of lasers is that it is very collimated. This means that most of the photons (particles of light) are travelling mostly in the same direction. 

In this case, most of the photons travel towards the direction of the wall (as seen by the red lines in the diagram above). Hence, very few photons travel to our eyes and we are therefore unable to observe the laser beam. 

Upon reaching the wall, photons get reflected off the surface of the wall and into our eyes and appear as a dot.

**How does spraying the path taken by the laser allow us to see the laser beam?**

![](/images/science/Teens/observe%20laser%202.png)


When we spray the path taken by the laser with water, the water droplets (seen by the blue circles in the diagram) act as reflective surfaces. 

Hence, the photons that come from the laser beam are reflected off the water droplets and into our eyes, allowing us to see the laser beam. However, as the water droplets spread out away from the path taken by the laser, it loses its effect and we have to spray water on the laser path for us to observe the path again.

**Bonus Thinking Question**<br>
Have you seen the light and water show at Marina Bay? How does it work?

**Activity 2. Sunset in a Bottle**
![](/images/science/Teens/sunset%20bottle.png)
	
In the previous activity, we learned that light travels in a straight line. Now, let’s find out how light can scatter by making your very own sunset in a bottle!  


Materials 

* 1 Clear bottle/glass with smooth surface (at least 25cm tall) 

* Water (enough to fill bottle/glass) 

* ¼ cup of milk  

* 1 Dropper/teaspoon 

* 1 Chopstick 

* 1 Torch light that emits white light 

**Steps and Questions** 

1. Fill your bottle all the way with tap water. 

2. In a dark room, shine your torch light through the water from the top of the bottle and from the side of the bottle. 

a. When you look at the bottle from the front, what is the colour of the water?  

b. What is the colour of the light travelling through the water?  

3. Add milk to the water one drop at a time using your dropper/teaspoon. Stir after each drop with your chopstick, while shining the torch light through the mixture from the top. 
![](/images/science/Teens/image1.png)

a.  When you look at the bottle from the front, what colour is the mixture? Is the colour of the mixture the same throughout, or is it different at the top compared to the bottom? Can you explain your observations?

4.  Instead of shining the torch light from the top, now shine it from the side of your bottle.
![](/images/science/Teens/image2.png)

a. What changes do you observe when you shine the light from the side instead of from the top? <br>

b. When viewing the bottle from the side directly opposite your torch light, what is the colour of the light travelling through the mixture?
<br>

5. Keep adding drops of milk while shining the torch light from the side. Observe what happens to the colour of light travelling through the mixture. <br>

a. When viewing the bottle from the side directly opposite your torch light, what is the colour of the light travelling through the mixture?

**Bonus:**

6. Try different solutions from your kitchen!<br>

a. Can you replace the milk with other substances (e.g., different flavours of milk, juice, carbonated drinks, soap, detergent, etc.) and still get the same results? What do all these substances have in common?

**Science Time!**

|<img src="/images/science/Teens/image023.jpg" alt="Bottle" style="width: 50%;" align="left">|<img src="/images/science/Teens/image021.jpg" alt="Bottle" style="width: 50%;" align="left">|

Did you see a “sunset” in your bottle? With only water in your bottle, you should see a colourless solution with a beam of white light passing through. When you add milk to the water, you should see some colour changes of light when viewing the milk-water mixture from the side and from the top. Can you figure out why?

The majority of light that reaches Earth from the sun is white light. White light is a combination of many colours of light, which can be seen in a rainbow when white light is separated into its individual colours by raindrops (as illustrated by the diagram above).

As seen in the diagram above, each colour is characterised by a certain wavelength. Wavelengths of blue light are shorter and have more energy, while wavelengths of red light are longer with less energy. When light waves hit an object, they can be 1) reflected; 2) absorbed; or 3) scattered and deflected to a different direction.

Why is the sky blue even though most of the light that reaches Earth is white light? This is due to Rayleigh scattering the diagram above).

The white light that reaches Earth interacts with gas molecules in the atmosphere (e.g. nitrogen and oxygen) and is scattered in all directions. However, not all wavelengths of light are scattered the same way. Shorter wavelengths, like blue light, are scattered much more than longer wavelengths in all directions. The scattered blue light is what we see and this is what makes the sky look blue!

At sunset, due to the position of the sun, sunlight has to pass through a greater distance in the atmosphere to reach your eyes. This gives the blue light more time to scatter and a lot more blue light gets scattered away through the atmosphere. 

The remaining wavelengths of light that you see are now longer wavelengths that are less scattered, such as orange and red. Small particles in the air enhance the scattering effect, which is why on hazy days, the sunsets appear even redder!

Can you now explain the colours you saw in your milk-water mixture? Milk is an emulsion, which means it consists of tiny insoluble fat particles dispersed in the mixture.

When you point your torch light at the milk-water mixture, the light waves interact with the fat particles in the mixture and get scattered - the same way sunlight gets scattered by gas molecules in the atmosphere! 

As blue light gets scattered most, your solution should have appeared slightly blue. Shining light from the top through the solution increases the distance the light waves have to travel through the mixture. That means that blue light can be scattered away even more throughout the solution. This is why at the bottom of the bottle, there is almost no blue light left anymore and it looks yellow or orange.

As you add more drops of milk, almost all the blue light is scattered away by the particles in the mixture. This is why the colour of the light you see through the mixture becomes orange, just like a sunset!

Activity 3. 3D Hologram Projector
![](/images/science/Teens/3D%20hologram%20projector.png)

**Background** <br>
Have you ever seen holograms in movies? Holograms have been a huge part of science fiction blockbuster movies, such as the Iron Man and Star Wars franchises. It may seem like having a hologram is a far-fetched idea meant for a euphoric world. What if YOU can create your very own 3D hologram from the comfort of your home?

From the previous activities, you would have learned some of the fundamental concepts of light. With the knowledge that light travels in a straight line, let’s explore how a “floating image” is produced through the use of a hologram projector!

**Materials** <br>
●      1 piece of stiff plastic sheet (You can also use recycled items such as an old CD case or disposable food containers)

●      Template in Annex A (If you do not have access to a printer, you can also make your own template! Draw a basic "Trapezoid" on a piece of paper based on the dimensions in Annex A.)

●      1 Smartphone

●      1 piece of Clear tape

●      1 pair of Scissors

●      1 Ruler

●      1 Marker/ Pen

**Steps**
1. Trace the template on the transparent film using your marker and ruler.

![](/images/science/Teens/image047.jpg)

2. Cut out along the black outline. (Be careful with the sharp scissors! Get an adult to help you with it!)

3. Fold along the lines in red.

4. Stick the two edges together with clear tape to form a pyramid.

7. Now, switch off the lights and get down to the same level as the device, watch, and enjoy!
 
**Bonus:**

8. What happens when you try to touch the “floating image”?

9. Use your finger to block the inner face of the pyramid. Are you still able to see the image?

10. Use your finger to block the video (under the plastic pyramid that hangs over) on your smartphone. Are you still able to see the image?

11. Compare the hologram image and the image on the smartphone.

**Science time!**

 How is the hologram image formed? The 3D hologram projector works on the principle of Pepper’s Ghost. In a Pepper's Ghost Illusion, when a real image is reflected in a transparent screen at a 45-degree angle, viewers see a reflected virtual image that seems to have depth and appear out of nowhere.

Four symmetrically opposite variations of the same image are projected onto the four faces of the pyramid. By principle, each side projects the image falling on it to the center of the pyramid. These projections work in unison to form a whole figure, which creates a 3D illusion.

By playing the videos, light rays are emitted from your smartphone and off the projection pyramid. The reflected light ray will now travel into your eyes, allowing you to see the moving images! Since the image formed in virtual, it is not projected on a screen but rather, appears to be floating in midair.
