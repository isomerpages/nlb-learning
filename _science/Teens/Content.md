<p> When we think of everyday science, we might picture the obvious — electricity which keeps appliances running, potted plants which undergo photosynthesis, and so on. But what about video games? </p>

<p> Many video games are full of scientific elements. Take the popular game Animal Crossing: New Horizons, for example. In this game, you can fill your day-to-day activities with crafting, trading, and even crossbreeding flowers.</p>

<p> According to players, this crossbreeding algorithm mimics Mendelian inheritance (Source: <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/technology/the-hidden-science-behind-2020s-biggest-video-games">Discover Magazine</a>, 2020), whereby various traits such as a flower’s colour are a result of a mix of dominant and recessive alleles (Source: <a href="https://blog.science.edu.sg/2020/07/23/animal-crossing/">I Saw the Science</a>, 2020).</p>

<p>Even Pokémon’s creators were inspired by theories of evolution and parasitism. Check out this video on how science makes an appearance in this beloved game:</p>

Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xGvvulC1EDk">Pokemon &amp; Science, Did You Know Gaming?</a>
	
<p>But there’s a bigger way science is present in almost all games. It forms one of the foundational elements a game is built on — its physics.</p>
	
<p>While gaming, if you’ve ever thrown an object or flown through the air, you might have experienced a game’s physics engine in play. This engine is a programme which creates a simulation of how objects move based on the laws of physics.</p>
	
<p>One of the more popular effects that game engines simulate is something called rigid body dynamics. According to <a href="https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Engineering/Courses/En4/notes_old/RigidKinematics/rigkin.htm">Brown University</a>, rigid body dynamics is “an idealisation of a body that does not deform or change shape.” </p>
	
<p>Simply put, it is the way in which solid and inflexible objects move. Humans, pets, buses, and trains are all examples of rigid bodies. </p>
	
<p>Rigid body dynamics can be simulated using the basis of Newton’s laws of motion: the law of inertia, the law of mass and acceleration, and the law of motion (Source: <a href="https://www.toptal.com/game/video-game-physics-part-i-an-introduction-to-rigid-body-dynamics">Toptal</a> , 2015).</p>
	
<p>Using these laws, various differential equations determined by forces and geometry can be created (Source: <a href="https://www.myphysicslab.com/">My Physics Lab</a>). The physics engine then uses these equations to generate iterations of object movement, such as a car moving or a cat walking. </p>

<p>Take a look at this video to see how physics is utilised when building a racing game:</p>
	
<div class="bp-youtube">
<iframe allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" frameborder="0" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xz8RRxYwrhg" height="315" width="560"></iframe></div>
Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xz8RRxYwrhg">The Physics of Racing Games, Real Engineering</a> 

<p>So, why isn’t physics always realistic in gameplay? First, it’s impossible to perfectly simulate real-world physics — there are just too many factors that can’t be accounted for. Second, a physics-defying game makes for more exciting gameplay.</p>

<p>In the game Portal, you’re able to use a gun to create portals which you or objects can travel through. Over the years, questions from players have been emerging on how the laws of physics would fare through teleportation. Can you solve one of these paradoxes?</p>

**Introduction** <br>
How do we see things around us? Light! Let us watch a video that will teach us more about light.

[<img src="/images/science/light dr binocs.png" alt="youtube" style="width: 100%" align="left">](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7yTlp4gBTI)
Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7yTlp4gBTI">Light | The Dr. Binocs Show | Learn Videos For Kids</a>

Everything in life is dependent on light. Plants need light to carry out photosynthesis, while humans need natural light to help us produce Vitamin D and regulate our sleep patterns. Light also enables us to see the beauty of the world around us!

Fun fact: Do you know the word ‘photograph’ evolved from the ancient Greek words ‘phot-’ which means ‘light’ and ‘graph-’ which means writing? So essentially, the word ‘photograph’ means writing with light!

Here are three fun activities below that you can carry out at home to explore more about light and its fascinating properties.

**Activity 1. Visualising Laser Light with Water Mist**
![](/images/science/the%20path%20of%20a%20laser.png)

**Background** <br>
Have you ever wondered how light travels? In this activity, let us observe light and how it travels through a water mist.

Suggested: If you are unable to find the materials needed at home, watch the video below and read more about the science behind it under ‘Science Time!’.

Materials

●      1 Laser pointer

●      Water

●      1 Spray bottle (e.g. empty hand sanitiser spray bottle)

**Steps**

1. Switch on the laser pointer and shine it at a blank surface (e.g. a wall) in front of you. (Be careful not to shine the laser pointer into your eyes or the eyes of those around you!) What do you observe?
2. Fill up the spray bottle with water.
3. Shine the laser pointer on the wall and get a friend to help to spray water using a spray bottle along the path taken by the laser.
![](/images/science/image005.png)

What do you notice this time?

**Science Time!** <br>
Did you observe this?
[<img src="/images/science/laser wall.png" alt="Laser" style="width: 100%" align="left">](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Eay2CgCi4sA?feature=shares/)
<br>


**Why are we only able to observe the laser as a dot on the wall but unable to see the beam of laser initially?**
![](/images/science/observe%20laser.png)
A unique property of lasers is that it is very collimated. This means that most of the photons (particles of light) are travelling mostly in the same direction. 

In this case, most of the photons travel towards the direction of the wall (as seen by the red lines in the diagram above). Hence, very few photons travel to our eyes and we are therefore unable to observe the laser beam. 

Upon reaching the wall, photons get reflected off the surface of the wall and into our eyes and appear as a dot.

**How does spraying the path taken by the laser allow us to see the laser beam?**

![](/images/science/observe%20laser%202.png)


When we spray the path taken by the laser with water, the water droplets (seen by the blue circles in the diagram) act as reflective surfaces. 

Hence, the photons that come from the laser beam are reflected off the water droplets and into our eyes, allowing us to see the laser beam. However, as the water droplets spread out away from the path taken by the laser, it loses its effect and we have to spray water on the laser path for us to observe the path again.

**Bonus Thinking Question**<br>
Have you seen the light and water show at Marina Bay? How does it work?

**Activity 2. Sunset in a Bottle**
![](/images/science/Teens/sunset%20bottle.png)
	
In the previous activity, we learned that light travels in a straight line. Now, let’s find out how light can scatter by making your very own sunset in a bottle!  


Materials 

* 1 Clear bottle/glass with smooth surface (at least 25cm tall) 

* Water (enough to fill bottle/glass) 

* ¼ cup of milk  

* 1 Dropper/teaspoon 

* 1 Chopstick 

* 1 Torch light that emits white light 

**Steps and Questions** 

Fill your bottle all the way with tap water. 

In a dark room, shine your torch light through the water from the top of the bottle and from the side of the bottle. 

When you look at the bottle from the front, what is the colour of the water?  

What is the colour of the light travelling through the water?  

Add milk to the water one drop at a time using your dropper/teaspoon. Stir after each drop with your chopstick, while shining the torch light through the mixture from the top.
