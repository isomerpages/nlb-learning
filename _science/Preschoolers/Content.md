The best way for preschoolers to learn about STEAM is to show them the concepts through activities, hands-on experiments and engaging videos. 
  
We have curated videos in our playlists and resources in our learning packages to inspire your child to discover the world around them.  
  
<h3><b>Playlists and Learning Packages</b></h3>

Our **playlists** contain videos selected by our librarians to make Science fun and accessible to children. 

Check out our **learning packages**, complete with activities and tips, on STEAM topics that you can introduce to your child!

<b id="mightymultiply">Mighty Multiply and Divine Divide!</b>

Multiplication and division are the next steps following addition and subtraction. It may be challenging for young children to move on to these more complex operations but, slowly and surely, they will grasp the concepts. Other than watching these videos with your child to expose them to multiplication and division, one of the easiest ways to introduce children to these concepts is through sorting and grouping activities. 
<br><br>
For example, you could give them some buttons and guide them into grouping the buttons so that each group has the same number of buttons. 
Check this playlist out first before you go on and explore these powerful mathematical operations with your child!

**I Spy a Number Pattern!**

Developing pattern recognition in young children is not as daunting as one might think. Arranging objects or numbers according to a certain order is a good way to get children to put on their sequencing caps and try to find out how they relate to one another. Are the objects arranged from big to small, by colour or by shape?  How are 1, 3, 5, 9 and 11 related? What about 2, 4, 6, 8, 10? Are the numbers arranged in increasing or decreasing order? Have your children learn simple number patterns and soon, they may start devising their own. 

Check out the video resources below to understand more about sequencing and understanding number patterns.

**Stunning Shapes and Pretty Polygons!**

The world is full of shapes. Circles, squares, triangles, and rectangles—they are everywhere! Let us see if we can spot them! The concept of shapes is an introduction to understanding geometry and identifying traits. Teaching children about shapes is easy and fun as the concept of shapes involves creating and seeing visuals. They can try spotting and naming shapes in their environment, drawing them on paper, or making them with different objects!

**What Keeps Me on the Ground? Gravity!**

Did you know that if you walked on the moon, you would be floating around, unable to walk on the ground? Why do you think you can walk around easily on Earth? That’s because of gravity! Gravity is the pulling force that acts on you to ensure you stay fine and firm on the ground. It may have robbed us of the chance to fly but at least we know, we will always return to the Earth’s surface and not float up to the sun!  
  <br>

**Shine Bright, Little Light!**		
		
There are so many different light sources all around us. From the cheery sun in the sky to the indoor lamps that ensure we do not read in the dark, light is an important part of our lives. It helps us see, it helps plants photosynthesise, and it is behind many natural phenomenon like forming a rainbow! Check out the video resources below to understand more about light and its many forms. Children can learn about light, its properties, its functions, and how to play with it to understand it further.

**It’s Time to Learn About Time!**

Time is an interesting phenomenon. It is untouchable, invisible and yet it is always around us. We rely on time to let us know when we should be doing certain activities, such as eating breakfast or getting ready for school. Exposing children to the concept of time can not only be fun and fruitful but can also provide them with more control once they understand how time works in their lives. What does it mean to have 5 more minutes at the playground? Or that dinner will be ready in an hour? 
Check out the video resources below to understand more about time and its applications.

<p>Light is made up of waves. These waves travel from light sources, bounce off objects and come to our eyes, allowing us to see things. Light sources come in many forms. Lamp posts help light up streets. Stadium lights help us watch a late sports match. Computer monitors and television screens emit light to display images. Light can also come from flames, not just electricity, like from the bonfire during camping. And of course, the biggest main source of light for us: the Sun!</p>

<p>Acids and bases are present in the food that we eat and drink daily. Examples of acidic drinks are orange juice or vinegar, and they taste sour. Bases, like egg whites and baking soda, taste bitter. <br><br> Scientists use a pH scale, ranging from 0 to 14, to measure how acidic and basic a substance is. Do you know that we can make our own pH indicator in the comfort of our homes? Check it out! </p>
