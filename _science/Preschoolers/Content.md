**Microscopic World: Protecting the Body! Science Behind Medical Biotechnology**

In this playlist, discover with your child how our bodies keep us safe from germs with antibodies. However, explain that sometimes, that may not be enough. Keep watching together to learn how scientists over the years invented vaccines and antibiotics to help boost your immune systems to ward off serious illnesses. You may even talk about some of the common vaccines available today and how they strengthen our bodies against viruses! Perhaps, the next vaccination with the doctor may become easier to manage.
