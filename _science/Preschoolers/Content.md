The best way for preschoolers to learn about STEAM is to show them the concepts through activities, hands-on experiments and engaging videos. 
  
We have curated videos in our playlists and resources in our learning packages to inspire your child to discover the world around them.  
  
<h3><b>Playlists and Learning Packages</b></h3>

Our **playlists** contain videos selected by our librarians to make Science fun and accessible to children. 

Check out our **learning packages**, complete with activities and tips, on STEAM topics that you can introduce to your child!

Lamp posts help light up streets. Stadium lights help us watch a late sports match. Computer monitors and television screens emit light to display images. Light can also come from flames, not just electricity, like from the bonfire during camping. And of course, the biggest main source of light for us: the Sun!</p>
