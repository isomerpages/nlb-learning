Think of learning pathways as appetizers. Get started on your learning journey with curated programmes and content before delving deeper into topics that interest you.

We start with <a href="#cultivating-appreciation"> Cultivating Appreciation for the Arts</a>. Following that, we will proceed to <a href="#learn-skills"> Learning Skills and Supporting the Creation of Artworks</a> and finally, we end with <a href="#participating-art"> Participating in the Art Community</a>.

<h3 id="cultivating-appreciation" class="margin--bottom--lg"><b> Cultivating Appreciation for the Arts </b></h3>
When it comes to discovering and cultivating appreciation for the Arts, there are so many entry points to do so and yet too many that we might be confused on where to start. But why develop an appreciation for the Arts? Firstly, it helps us to develop our eyes and minds as we encounter what we see in it. It also helps open our mindset by listening to different perspectives and views as well as interpretations. It encourages thoughtful conversation and the understanding that there is more than one approach to everything. 
Through this pathway you can explore different resources and learn ways to cultivate aesthetic appreciation.

Zines have been at the centre of radical culture for decades.

Today, zines have entered the art world and are being marketed as limited-edition artefacts and collectibles.
