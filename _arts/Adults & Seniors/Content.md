<h5 id="lp-how-to-view-art" class="margin--bottom--lg"><b>How To View Art</b></h5>
<p> The way we view art has changed with the proliferation of cameras, digital screens, duplicates and photo manipulation. The invention of the camera completely changed our sense of perspective because now we can see things in places our eyes have never travelled to. It has changed the context with which we view art because we can now see a painting or work in a different setting from what the artist intended, thus giving us a different perspective of the art.
</p>
<table border="1">
	<tbody><tr>
		<td>
			<h2>Did you know...</h2>
			<p> The camera’s history can be traced back to the Middle Ages with the first pinhole camera. A physicist by the name of Alhazen discovered the idea of Camera Obscura, which led him to the creation of the first pinhole camera. Camera Obscura, in short, is reproducing an image with colour and perspective preserved. <sup><small><a href="#lp-how-to-view-art">1</a></small></sup>.</p>

<h5>2. Ways of Seeing, Episode 3 (1972)</h5> 
<p> With the invention of oil paint around 1400, painters were able to portray people and objects with an unprecedented degree of realism, and painting became the ideal way to celebrate private possessions. In this programme, John Berger questions the value we place on that tradition. </p>

<h5>5. Art and Empathy </h5>
