<h5 id="lp-how-to-view-art" class="margin--bottom--lg"><b>How To View Art</b></h5>
<p> The way we view art has changed with the proliferation of cameras, digital screens, duplicates and photo manipulation. The invention of the camera completely changed our sense of perspective because now we can see things in places our eyes have never travelled to. It has changed the context with which we view art because we can now see a painting or work in a different setting from what the artist intended, thus giving us a different perspective of the art.
</p>
<table border="1">
	<tbody><tr>
		<td>
			<h2>Did you know...</h2>
			<p> The camera’s history can be traced back to the Middle Ages with the first pinhole camera. A physicist by the name of Alhazen discovered the idea of Camera Obscura, which led him to the creation of the first pinhole camera. Camera Obscura, in short, is reproducing an image with colour and perspective preserved. <sup><small><a href="#lp-how-to-view-art">1</a></small></sup>.</p>

<h5>1. Ways of Seeing, Episode 1 (1972)</h5>

<h5>2. Ways of Seeing, Episode 3 (1972)</h5> 
<p> With the invention of oil paint around 1400, painters were able to portray people and objects with an unprecedented degree of realism, and painting became the ideal way to celebrate private possessions. In this programme, John Berger questions the value we place on that tradition. </p>

<h5>5. Art and Empathy </h5> 
<p> Empathy is a term we hear a lot, but what does it mean and how does it work? Looking back through art history, we find many moments when art has allowed us to share in the feelings of others, from Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial, to representations of the Buddhist deity Jizō Bosatsu, the ink drawings of Chittaprosad and Zainul Abedin, the work of Ghana Think Tank, and more. </p>

</p><p> The amphitheatre of the Greeks, the proscenium stage on West End, the wayang platform in Singapore — these venues of entertainment where live performances took place were locations that first kept people glued to their seats.

<h5>4. Popular Disney Songs for Instrumentalists</h5>

</p><p> Instrumental musicians often face the challenge of covering popular songs in the absence of lyrics — a struggle that vocalists may not be conscious of. Lyrics and lyrical variations help to break the monotony of repeated notes or melodic lines common in pop melodies, otherwise, such songs can end up sounding dull and monotonous when performed solely with instruments. This problem is exacerbated for instruments that are not truly polyphonic like the flute or violin. This article lists noteworthy musical pieces from Disney movies that can be added to an instrumentalist’s repertoire.
