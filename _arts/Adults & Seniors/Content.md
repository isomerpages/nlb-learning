<h5 id="lp-how-to-view-art" class="margin--bottom--lg"><b>How To View Art</b></h5>
<p> The way we view art has changed with the proliferation of cameras, digital screens, duplicates and photo manipulation. The invention of the camera completely changed our sense of perspective because now we can see things in places our eyes have never travelled to. It has changed the context with which we view art because we can now see a painting or work in a different setting from what the artist intended, thus giving us a different perspective of the art.
</p>
<table border="1">
	<tbody><tr>
		<td>
			<h2>Did you know...</h2>
			<p> The camera’s history can be traced back to the Middle Ages with the first pinhole camera. A physicist by the name of Alhazen discovered the idea of Camera Obscura, which led him to the creation of the first pinhole camera. Camera Obscura, in short, is reproducing an image with colour and perspective preserved. <sup><small><a href="#lp-how-to-view-art">1</a></small></sup>.</p>

<h5>1. Ways of Seeing, Episode 1 (1972)</h5>

<h5>2. Ways of Seeing, Episode 3 (1972)</h5> 
<p> With the invention of oil paint around 1400, painters were able to portray people and objects with an unprecedented degree of realism, and painting became the ideal way to celebrate private possessions. In this programme, John Berger questions the value we place on that tradition. </p>

<h5>5. Art and Empathy </h5> 
<p> Empathy is a term we hear a lot, but what does it mean and how does it work? Looking back through art history, we find many moments when art has allowed us to share in the feelings of others, from Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial, to representations of the Buddhist deity Jizō Bosatsu, the ink drawings of Chittaprosad and Zainul Abedin, the work of Ghana Think Tank, and more. </p>

</p><p> Instrumental musicians often face the challenge of covering popular songs in the absence of lyrics — a struggle that vocalists may not be conscious of. Lyrics and lyrical variations help to break the monotony of repeated notes or melodic lines common in pop melodies, otherwise, such songs can end up sounding dull and monotonous when performed solely with instruments. This problem is exacerbated for instruments that are not truly polyphonic like the flute or violin. This article lists noteworthy musical pieces from Disney movies that can be added to an instrumentalist’s repertoire.

<h4>The Artist behind the art</h4>
							
<p> Raden Saleh (c. 1811), born in Semarang, Central Java, Indonesia into a family of the ruling elite, is widely regarded as the first modern painter in Indonesia (then known as the Dutch East Indies). In 1829, Raden Saleh went to Holland where he studied landscape and portrait painting. For the next 20 years or so, he lived in Europe and gained royal patronage, including the official title of 'King's Painter' of the Netherlands. His work was shown at many important, large public exhibitions of the period, known as 'salons'.

<h4>What is Batik?</h4>
<p> Batik painting is the process in which patterns or images are dyed onto fabric, usually using a wax-resist technique followed by the application of the dye.
</p>
<h5> How traditional Javanese Batik is made? </h5>
<p> Watch Javanese artisans make batik and learn more about their refined techniques. Many places in the world pattern textiles by applying wax to protect certain areas from dye. During the dye process, the wax areas resist the dye, and when the wax is removed a pattern emerges. Both the technique and the textile produced are called batik.</p>

<h5> Singaporean Artist Tumadi Patri shows how he creates his Batik artwork </h5>
<p>This demonstration by contemporary batik artist Tumadi Patri illuminates the numerous processes behind batik painting. Tumadi begins by sketching a visual concept on paper before transferring it onto fabric. Liquid wax is then funnelled through a canting, a pen-like instrument, to outline the image on the fabric which is then dyed. To remove the wax, the fabric is dipped in a mixture of hot water and soda ash, then cold water. The steps of waxing, dyeing and washing may be carried out numerous times for intricate designs, a testament to the complexity of batik art.</p>

<h5>2. Jaafar Latiff</h5>

<p> From colourful threads found on the floor of an ancient Georgian cave to the Indian calicoes that fuelled the Industrial Revolution, The Golden Thread illuminates the myriad and fascinating histories behind the cloths that came to define human civilization—the fabric, for example, that allowed mankind to shatter athletic records, and the textile technology that granted us the power to survive in space. Exploring the enduring association of textiles with "women's work," Kassia St. Clair "spins a rich social history . . . that also reflects the darker side of technology".</p>
