       <td style="width: 40%;"> Menopause is a normal part of the ageing process and is characterised by the lack of menstruation for 12 months or longer. As menopause can be quite an unfamiliar experience, there is a lot of misinformation surrounding it.

      <td style="width: 40%;">In spite of all the modern day conveniences, we are collectively riddled with a constant state of tension and uneasiness. This dis-_ease_, called ‘anxiety’ is an apprehension of the future, rooted in a preoccupation with the past, and which robs us of the gift of the present. Anxiety cripples our health, handicaps our relationships, and constricts our experience of life. In this talk, Dr Sanjiv examines  the plague of modern day anxiety, and reflects on how we can manage better - and perhaps even thrive exuberantly.</td>

	<td style="width: 40%;"><b>Managing Medications</b><br><br>
A simple medical label contains a lot of vital information such as quantity, ingredients, and uses. Not knowing how to interpret this information can lead to us ingesting the wrong type of medication or consuming medication in wrong dosages. The speaker, Ms Annie Tran (pharmacist), will guide you through how to read medical labels and provide tips on managing multiple medications.
<br><br>
		<b>Understanding Dizziness</b>
<br><br>Dizziness causes a sense of imbalance and often occurs with other symptoms like nausea and vomiting. As it is difficult to predict how long each bout of dizziness will last for, the risk of falls can also increase. Hear from our speakers Dr Joyce Tang (ear, nose, and throat doctor) and Dr Dawn Tan (Senior Principal Physiotherapist) as they take you through the causes of dizziness and ways to effectively manage them.
