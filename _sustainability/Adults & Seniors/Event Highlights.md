<img src="/images/sustainability/adults-and-seniors/GMO_eDM_600x300_1.jpg" style="width:300px;height:200px;">

The Great Make-Over Project is an annual project that brings together everyday people to co-solution, reinvent, and reimagine spaces to promote sustainable living. 
Over the course of six weeks, 25 individuals, from different walks of life such as homemakers, artists and entrepreneurs, were divided into five teams and explored the question – “What would Choa Chu Kang look like when our community spaces are reimagined for sustainability?”

The teams also conducted ground-up research to value-add to their projects. From locating potential spaces for reimagination to interviewing members of the public, the teams went the extra mile to ensure that these projects would translate to enticing and inclusive green solutions for the people of Choa Chu Kang.
