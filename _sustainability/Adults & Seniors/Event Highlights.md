How will the Punggol neighborhood look like if it was re:Imagined to be more sustainable, vibrant and inclusive? The second iteration of The Great Make-Over Project (GMO) brought together 5 teams to do exactly that! With sustainability in mind, GMO participants sought to visualize and transform specific places within the neighborhood into “Great Places”.  

<b><u>About The Great Make-Over Project:</u></b>

The Great Make-Over Project (GMO) is a community co-solutioning initiative which tasks participants to propose ways to transform and reinvent spaces to promote sustainable living. 

This project is supported by CapitaLand Hope Foundation, One Punggol CC and Pasir-Ris Punggol Town Council. 

<h3><b>Their Journey</b></h3>
<p>
24 participants were selected from a pool of 83 applicants to be part of the second iteration of The Great Make-Over Project. These participants included a community designer, nurse, students, retirees, housewives and sustainability consultants. 
</p><img src="/images/sustainability/adults-and-seniors/as_sustainability_gmo_1.png">

<p>
Over the course of 4 months, GMO participants underwent a curriculum of design-thinking and placemaking workshops as well as fireside side chats with industry practitioners and sustainability enthusiasts to lay the groundwork for the solutioning process.
</p>
<p>
Separately, the teams also conducted preliminary research for their green solutions. From on-the-ground assessment of potential spaces for reimagination to interviewing members of the public, the teams went the extra mile to ensure that these projects would translate to green solutions for the Punggol Town community.
</p>

<p>
On 15th April 2023, the teams presented their reimagined spaces and creative green solutions to a panel of judges comprising of representatives from the Pasir Ris-Punggol Town Council, the National Environment Agency, the National Library Board and City Sprouts. 
</p>
<p>
The teams will also be sharing their ideas with the public on 6 May from 11am to 1pm at Punggol Regional Library - Entrance (Level 1). Join us to learn more about their innovative sustainability solutions and share your own feedback and ideas!
