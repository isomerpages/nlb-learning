## The Great Make-Over Project
<img src="/images/sustainability/adults-and-seniors/Digital%20Bulletin%20Board.png" style="width:300px;height:500px;">

The Great Make-Over Project, a community co-solutioning initiative by NLB and supported by CapitaLand Hope Foundation, brings together everyday people to co-solution, reinvent, and reimagine spaces to promote sustainable living. 
Over the course of six weeks, 25 individuals, from different walks of life such as homemakers, artists and entrepreneurs, were divided into five teams and explored the question – “What would Choa Chu Kang look like when our community spaces are reimagined for sustainability?”

<b>Check out the posters of the teams' finalized ideas:</b>
<br><a href="https://go.gov.sg/team1sproutup/" target="_blank">Team 1 Sprout Up!</a>
<br>
<div class="green-text">
Sprout Up! has re:imagined Lot One Mall Rooftop. The teams’ short-term goals include creating green space for ethical and social marketplaces to thrive. This includes organizing eco-practice interactive workshops and games, setting up vertical gardens and recycling collection points. 
In the long term, the team envisions Level 5 of Lot One Mall to be a space where the community comes together to grow food, a more robust green infrastructure and even a nature-based playground to get the young involved in sustainability. 
</div>

<br><a href="https://go.gov.sg/team2staysustainable/" target="_blank">Team 2 Stay Sustainable</a>
<br>
<div class="green-text">
Stay Sustainable has re:imagined CCK Community Centre. The teams’ short-term goals include knowledge-sharing through workshops and digital content on topics such as upcycling and composting. Stay Sustainable would also like to set up community compost bins and self-deposit corners for clothes and books to encourage more sustainable practices among the community. 
The teams’ long-term plans are to revitalize the CCK Community Centre with green wall features and create rooftop gardens. Additionally, the team would like to set up community establishments for dining, studying, co-working and lifestyle practices that embraces sustainability at its core. 
 </div>
 
<br><a href="https://go.gov.sg/team3parkkaki/" target="_blank">Team 3 Park Kaki</a>
<br>
<div class="green-text">
Park Kaki has re:imagined Choa Chu Kang Park. In the short run, team Park Kaki hopes to organize various community initiatives from guided educational tours, eco wellness walks, farmers’ markets and even eco-themed storytelling and craft workshops. They also hope to mobilise the community to do park clean ups. 
In the long run, the team envisions Cho Chu Kang Park as a place for not only appreciation, but also to serve as a sustainability landmark in Choa Chu Kang where the community can appreciate the natural and historical heritage of the park.

<br><a href="https://go.gov.sg/team4sunshine/" target="_blank">Team 4 Sunshine</a>
<br>
<div class="green-text">
Sunshine has re:imagined Keat Hong Community Centre. They aim to use under-utilized ground floor areas to organize events for the community such as, movie screenings, swapathons, flea markets and hold pop-up markets for small businesses. The space would also feature recycling collection points and a potential collaboration with Two of a Kind for their collection bin. A compost bin would also be set-up to not only encourage the people but F&B establishments to compost food waste. The team’s long-term initiatives include establishing a “Library of Things” – this includes a community fridge, a “single-use plastics alternatives” area and more reading areas to encourage information sharing on sustainability.

<br><a href="https://go.gov.sg/team5socialtechfarmer/" target="_blank">Team 5 Social Tech Farmer</a>
<br>
<div class="green-text">
Social Tech Farmer has re:imagined an open green plot of land beside Pang Sua Park Connector . In the short-run, they envision the space to be more accessible, both for sustainable practices and for the people. This would include incorporating vermicomposting and aquaponics models, infrastructures for community gardens and ramps to increase accessibility to certain areas. Long-term plans for the space include setting up nurseries for various herbs, fruits, and plants and to encourage seedling sharing amongst the community. The space would then be transformed to conduct weekend activities such as garden fairs and educational tours.

Participants attended workshops that closely guided them in their design-thinking and placemaking process. Industry practitioners and sustainability enthusiasts conducted fireside chats and sharing sessions, lending the teams greater insights and knowledge to further refine their green solutions.

The teams also conducted ground-up research to value-add to their projects. From locating potential spaces for reimagination to interviewing members of the public, the teams went the extra mile to ensure that these projects would translate to enticing and inclusive green solutions for the people of Choa Chu Kang.
