The Great Make-Over Project is an annual project that brings together everyday people to co-solution, reinvent, and reimagine spaces to promote sustainable living. 
Over the course of six weeks, 25 individuals, from different walks of life such as homemakers, artists and entrepreneurs, were divided into five teams and explored the question – “What would Choa Chu Kang look like when our community spaces are reimagined for sustainability?”

Participants attended workshops that closely guided them in their design-thinking and placemaking process. Industry practitioners and sustainability enthusiasts conducted fireside chats and sharing sessions, lending the teams greater insights and knowledge to further refine their green solutions.

The teams also conducted ground-up research to value-add to their projects. From locating potential spaces for reimagination to interviewing members of the public, the teams went the extra mile to ensure that these projects would translate to enticing and inclusive green solutions for the people of Choa Chu Kang.

On 13th March 2022, participants presented the reimagined spaces and creative green solutions to a panel of judges consisting of representatives from the Choa Chu Kang Town Council, the National Environment Agency, and the National Library Board.
