<h3> Learning Package: Green Economy </h3>	
	
It’s common to think that sustainability and economic growth are mutually exclusive, thinking that one will compromise the other. However, economies globally are realising that developing the Green Economy could provide a competitive edge in economic opportunities while advancing sustainability and society’s welfare.<sup><small></small></sup></a><small><a href="#footnote-one">1</a></small>
	<p>As one of the key pillars of the Singapore Green Plan 2030, a whole-of-nation movement to advance Singapore’s national agenda on sustainable development<sup><small><a href="#footnote-two">2</a></small></sup> developing a Green Economy in Singapore refers to seeking green growth to create new jobs, transform industries and harness sustainability as a competitive advantage<sup><small><a href="#footnote-three">3</a></small></sup>.</p>
<p>In a green economy, growth in employment and income are driven by public and private investment into low carbon, resource efficient and socially inclusive economic activities, infrastructure, and assets that allow reduced carbon emissions and pollution, enhanced energy and resource efficiency, and prevention of the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services.<sup><small><a href="#footnote-four">4</a></small></sup></p>
<p>In the Green Plan, Singapore’s key targets are to Introduce an Enterprise Sustainability Programme, Create business and job opportunities, Be a leading centre for Green Finance in Asia and globally and to Promote homegrown innovation under the Research, Innovation and Enterprise Plan 2025.<sup><small><a href="#footnote-three">3</a></small></sup></p>
<p>As the global awareness for sustainability efforts increase, more corporations are heading towards more sustainable business models.

			<h2>Did you know...</h2>
			<p>In 2015, Amsterdam become one of the world’s first circular cities.<sup><a href="#footnote-five">5</a></sup> They were also the first city to get a circular city scan, in collaboration with Circle Economy<sup><a href="#footnote-six">6</a></sup>, which identifies those areas where the most significant, tangible progress in realizing a circular economy can be achieved<sup><a href="#footnote-seven">7</a></sup>. Through the circular city scan, they found out that both the food and the construction sector had large circular potential, with potentially high economic and environmental impact.</p>
			<p>Amsterdam’s approach to a circular economy is focused on 3 value chains<sup><a href="#footnote-eight">8</a></sup>.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Food and organic waste streams</li>
				<li>Consumer goods</li>
				<li>Built environment</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Singapore, however, is not too far behind. Through policies to encourage sustainable production and consumption, such as the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)<sup><a href="#footnote-nine">9</a></sup>, Singapore has begun to embrace the circular economy approach in several areas.</p>
			<p>On top of having almost all our construction waste and metals recycled, Singapore has also managed to close the water loop. This is possible through Singapore’s ability to endlessly recycle water, enabling it to be reused indefinitely! This has allowed Singapore to reintroduce up to almost 800,000 m<sup>3</sup> of ultra-pure recycled water into our system each day <sup><a href="#footnote-ten">10</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="lp-energy-sust">Learning Package: Energy Sustainability</h3>

<h5>Introduction</h5>
<p>Our energy needs are vast covering daily activities to industry use. The concern of our generation is to meet those needs through sustainable energy forms that are renewable and clean unlike fossil fuels that pollute and have been one of the main causes of climate change. Some examples of sustainable energy forms are solar, wind, water to geothermal power.</p>
<p>In Singapore, we depend on imports for our energy needs and are constrained in terms of options for renewable energy sources.  An energy strategy recently adopted resolves around four supply switches that promote cleaner power generation.<sup><a href="#footnote-one">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h5>Introduction</h5>
<p>Our fashion choices have an impact on the planet. Beyond the materials used to make a piece of clothing, where and how it is made, to its distribution, potential for reuse, repair, remake or recycle determine the extent of the environmental and social impact it has. We must also consider our consumption patterns and usage when we talk about sustainable fashion. The onus on making fashion more sustainable thus lies with all stakeholders from fashion companies to the consumers.</p>
<p>To help you untangle the topic of sustainable fashion and guide you in making better fashion choices and practices to adopt, check out the resources we have compiled here.</p>

<p>An urban city does not mean that it is all concrete. Vancouver and Singapore are some of the many cities in the world where one can find nature in the city. In recent years, architects and urban planners are incorporating nature when designing, planning, and building cities due to a variety of reasons. These reasons range from reducing heat and lowering temperature, increasing the quality of life to creating a natural habitat for animals and so on. </p>
<p> We have compiled a list of resources to help you understand the different initiatives implemented by different cities to develop and grow the green spaces in their urban environments. </p><p>

![](/images/sustainability/adults-and-seniors/renewable-energy-lp-header.png)
<p>Renewable energy is energy that is collected from renewable resources that are naturally replenished over time. Examples of renewable energy sources include solar energy from the sun, geothermal energy from heat inside the earth, wind energy and hydropower from flowing water. Renewable energy does not release pollutants into the air and does not strain our Earth’s natural resources.</p>
<p>With the advancement of technology and modernization of cities, energy and electricity use is increasing at a rapid pace. It is pivotal that we make the switch to renewable energy. Renewable energy can be used to produce electricity with lesser environmental impact. For example, we can produce electricity from renewable energy without producing cardon dioxide.</p>
<p>To help you learn more about renewable energy and its importance, check out the resources we have compiled here.</p>
