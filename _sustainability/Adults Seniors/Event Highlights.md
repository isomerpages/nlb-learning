## The Great Make-Over Project
![](/images/sustainability/adults-and-seniors/GMO_eDM_600x300_1.jpg)
The Great Make-Over Project is an annual project that brings together everyday people to co-solution, reinvent, and reimagine spaces to promote sustainable living. 
Over the course of six weeks, 25 individuals, from different walks of life such as homemakers, artists and entrepreneurs, were divided into five teams and explored the question – “What would Choa Chu Kang look like when our community spaces are reimagined for sustainability?”

Participants attended workshops that closely guided them in their design-thinking and placemaking process. Industry practitioners and sustainability enthusiasts conducted fireside chats and sharing sessions, lending the teams greater insights and knowledge to further refine their green solutions.
