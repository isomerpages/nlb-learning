#### **Think Green, Go Green!**

Engage with the world around you and pick up eco-friendly habits by repurposing the things you already have. Become part of a global initiative to combat climate change by making small lifestyle changes and adopting greener practices.

It’s often difficult to know where to begin, and you may feel like a small seed whose efforts make little difference. Don’t be discouraged! There are many things you can do, and most importantly, it is to get started.

Here are some resources to help you develop environmental mindfulness ☺️

**Part 1: Reconnect with Nature - Forest Bathing**<br>
Known as shinrin-yoku, forest bathing does not actually involve any bathing. Instead, it is an opportunity for you to leave your tech behind, and spend some quiet time immersed in nature. Learn more about forest bathing and its benefits through this video below:

Here are some simple steps to forest bathe in urban Singapore, so you can take a short breather from your hectic schedules and connect with the world around you:

* Choose a park with some trees near your home. Remember to pack water and food, and inform your parents/guardian on your whereabouts before leaving home.
* Immerse yourself in your surroundings as you wander around the park for at least 15 minutes.
* Listen to the sounds around you, look at the shapes of the leaves on the trees, and feel the sensation of the ground beneath your feet.
* If you are with someone, resist talking until the end of the walk.
* Self-reflect after your walk. How did you feel? What did you experience?

When seventeen-year-old Ishmael wakes up from stasis aboard the Pequod, he is amazed by how different this planet is from the dirty, dying, Shroud-covered Earth he left behind. But Ishmael isn’t on Cretacea to marvel at the fresh air, sunshine, and endless blue ocean. He’s here to work, risking his life to hunt down great ocean-dwelling beasts to harvest and send back to the resource-depleted Earth.
